Pizzanat#6176,"""Don't know"
J-Klar#4158,"""didn't get it"
karthiccc#0069,Top 10%? Idnt that better than top 90?
karthiccc#0069,Your in the smaller percentile
J-Klar#4158,No top 90 players
J-Klar#4158,which was 3% of 3000
karthiccc#0069,Ooooh
karthiccc#0069,Gotcha
karthiccc#0069,10% still pretty damn good
karthiccc#0069,So like you and merak both got top 10.
karthiccc#0069,*?
J-Klar#4158,Yeah he has one more point than me currently
J-Klar#4158,"""Hes still got two more games"
J-Klar#4158,so hes just gonna rush

BlazeThief#4311,The game crashed so i couldnt do my final game oof
karthiccc#0069,F
BlazeThief#4311,was six points off
BlazeThief#4311,it could have been the difference
karthiccc#0069,Off what?
BlazeThief#4311,36 was top 3000 which is what you need to qualify
BlazeThief#4311,i got 30
karthiccc#0069,If you played your last game would you have qualified?
BlazeThief#4311,maybe
BlazeThief#4311,depends on how well i did
karthiccc#0069,How many points per game?
BlazeThief#4311,3 points for top 25
BlazeThief#4311,and 1 per elimination
BlazeThief#4311,also more for top 15 10 and 3
karthiccc#0069,So if you got 3 kills and top 25 you could have gotten in
BlazeThief#4311,theres another tournament going on in like 2 days anyways so we are all good
karthiccc#0069,Dang

BlazeThief#4311,because he doesnt want to get it so were bad for liking something he doesnt
BlazeThief#4311,its also remastered some pog maps like origins and moon
Lucаs#7263,wdym we like it jake never said a thing
Lucаs#7263,and its worse according to player count and also sales

Lucаs#7263,ok jake asked how its worse so i showed him
BlazeThief#4311,its not even worse
BlazeThief#4311,they are litterally the same
BlazeThief#4311,if not bo2 is like 50 more players
Lucаs#7263,considering it gained more money and its performing the same as the sequel game id say its better
Lucаs#7263,literally the newer game is doing slightly worse
Lucаs#7263,look at the player count of CSGO vs CS Source and youll see why csgo is better

maximumeffort1#3058,eh
BlazeThief#4311,Dang is it even fun though?
maximumeffort1#3058,it kinda sucked
maximumeffort1#3058,but for 6 dollars
J-Klar#4158,They changed it a lot im pre sure
J-Klar#4158,It would be fun for us to just play casually
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah i guess
J-Klar#4158,Way more fun than somehting like cod or battlefield because there's way more depth
J-Klar#4158,Idk
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah i may get it
maximumeffort1#3058,how long is it on sale for
J-Klar#4158,until 25th
maximumeffort1#3058,ye ill prob get it
maximumeffort1#3058,i mean 6 bucks
BlazeThief#4311,but did you see the tournament end there
BlazeThief#4311,there was literally like 5 people not in ballers
J-Klar#4158,This really isn't news
J-Klar#4158,Games been trash for a very long time
J-Klar#4158,There just haven't been any investments
J-Klar#4158,And people are too committed at this point
BlazeThief#4311,True
BlazeThief#4311,I wonder how the casters feel when they see stuff like that
BlazeThief#4311,they probably are not allowed to call epic out on it
J-Klar#4158,Yeah they can't do anything
J-Klar#4158,Probably can't even read half the names of players because they'd all be hating on Epic names
BlazeThief#4311,true
BlazeThief#4311,There was a fake tfue in the touney
BlazeThief#4311,and the casters thought it was the real one oof
J-Klar#4158,btw Respawn vans are actually gonna be in comp. I think the only reason they weren't was because of a bug
BlazeThief#4311,LOL
J-Klar#4158,So end game would literally be a 100 player lobby
BlazeThief#4311,You wanted that point in the tourney how about it just disappears
J-Klar#4158,Yeah points were dipping faster than viewer numbers
maximumeffort1#3058,whats the point if everyone was still alive in the endgame?
J-Klar#4158,Now you're realising
J-Klar#4158,These are the real questions
J-Klar#4158,A battle royale should be a story
J-Klar#4158,Beginning middle end
maximumeffort1#3058,Dude
J-Klar#4158,Fortnite has an end
maximumeffort1#3058,Thats deep
BlazeThief#4311,were in the endgame now
J-Klar#4158,You'd think if they only had one stage it would be a perfected stage? Nope. Game barely works end games
maximumeffort1#3058,bout time the game died
maximumeffort1#3058,it was fun for a bit
J-Klar#4158,Game would be fun if they fixed all the issues
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah
maximumeffort1#3058,and maybe if there were a little less sweats
J-Klar#4158,No that's not an issue
J-Klar#4158,I'm really sick of people saying that. let people play how they want to
J-Klar#4158,By sweats people literally mean the players that are better than them
J-Klar#4158,Just get gud
maximumeffort1#3058,or its the people who try to hard
J-Klar#4158,How can you try to hard?
J-Klar#4158,I don't think you can try to hard when coming last place at worlds gives you 50k
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah but thats a world cup
maximumeffort1#3058,think of casual games
J-Klar#4158,Maybe you just don't try hard enough ^ also you have to practice to get to worlds
maximumeffort1#3058,underline the word casual
BlazeThief#4311,They litterally added arena mode for a reason
maximumeffort1#3058,exactly
BlazeThief#4311,and you still complain
J-Klar#4158,Yeah exactly Kyle
J-Klar#4158,Just play Arena
maximumeffort1#3058,if you wanna sweat go play arena
J-Klar#4158,No you should play arena if you don't enjoy sweats
BlazeThief#4311,Sweat is litterally when someone is just playing the game to try to win
BlazeThief#4311,people only say sweat when they got clapped by someone
maximumeffort1#3058,but really its the games were your having fun and doing good and you die to something stupid
J-Klar#4158,Wut?
J-Klar#4158,There is no such thing as a sweat anyway. I could be the worst player in the world but be trying my hardest and you wouldn't be mad when you killed me
J-Klar#4158,"""It's not about them trying"
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,It be like that
maximumeffort1#3058,if  there was any sort of way they coud 100% fix the game id be sure to go back to it
BlazeThief#4311,But until then kyle will make fun of anyone who mentions fortnite
maximumeffort1#3058,more like karthick will
maximumeffort1#3058,i really dont care if you like it or not
BlazeThief#4311,and the way the game is going it looks like its going to die off in the next year or so
BlazeThief#4311,unless they can get their stuff together soon
maximumeffort1#3058,i dont even think its going to last a year
J-Klar#4158,"""That's like me making fun of switch players for also having a young fanbase"
J-Klar#4158,Games gonna die 6 months after worlds
maximumeffort1#3058,jake
J-Klar#4158,Make my wor
J-Klar#4158,d
J-Klar#4158,s
maximumeffort1#3058,i already agreed with you
BlazeThief#4311,"""""""make my words"""" speech 100"""
J-Klar#4158,I'm not talking about that lol?
J-Klar#4158,^ crap
J-Klar#4158,"""I'm just talking about the general stigma Fortnite gets from all these people who have spent hundreds of hours playing the game"
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah
maximumeffort1#3058,but is the meta okay
maximumeffort1#3058,its the real question
J-Klar#4158,"""I hate Fortnite"
BlazeThief#4311,Its not even a matter of adapting to new metas like something like overwatch its that the games map is constantly changing with the most random updates being thrown in
J-Klar#4158,"""A meta is always ok in Fortnite"
maximumeffort1#3058,i dont like it for more than just people being better than me
J-Klar#4158,I'm not talking about you specifically
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah i know
BlazeThief#4311,But guys
J-Klar#4158,You can pet dogs
BlazeThief#4311,Exactly
J-Klar#4158,:D
BlazeThief#4311,:YoshiDabber69:
J-Klar#4158,Imagine communicating with your main playerbase
J-Klar#4158,Nah
maximumeffort1#3058,its really the random updates and weapons they keep coming out with that makes it bad
J-Klar#4158,Screams in casual
BlazeThief#4311,I should just buy the gamecube controller stuff and devote all my time to smash
J-Klar#4158,nah fka smash
maximumeffort1#3058,oh god
BlazeThief#4311,fka?
maximumeffort1#3058,merak please
J-Klar#4158,fka = fuck a
maximumeffort1#3058,i already suck
BlazeThief#4311,LOL
maximumeffort1#3058,i dont need you kicking my ass in smash
BlazeThief#4311,I remember 1v3ing you karthik and jasper
J-Klar#4158,If you want to devote all your time to a game wait for a new game that gets super popular and that you know isn't going to get a sequal
maximumeffort1#3058,i killed
maximumeffort1#3058,you
BlazeThief#4311,but you guys just sprayed me down
BlazeThief#4311,it was a rip
BlazeThief#4311,i beat you in 1v2s though
maximumeffort1#3058,it was a cheap kill
BlazeThief#4311,I want something popular to come out
maximumeffort1#3058,but im talking i suck at smash
BlazeThief#4311,apex was close but it died off
maximumeffort1#3058,apex was so close
BlazeThief#4311,the battlepass was underwhelming so people didnt stay long
maximumeffort1#3058,yeah
J-Klar#4158,Because a battle royale needs more than just shooting
maximumeffort1#3058,true!
J-Klar#4158,Building is the reason Fortnite is so popular
BlazeThief#4311,But it wont die for awhile since shroud still plays it
BlazeThief#4311,True
BlazeThief#4311,apex had the classes that were actually good
maximumeffort1#3058,who tf still watches shroud
BlazeThief#4311,usually 20 to 40 thousand
J-Klar#4158,He had the most subs on twitch :D
J-Klar#4158,He's in second rn
J-Klar#4158,So
J-Klar#4158,A lot
BlazeThief#4311,whos first
BlazeThief#4311,tfue?
J-Klar#4158,Ye
BlazeThief#4311,Ninja said he has 20 k rn
maximumeffort1#3058,lets just hope a good game that will beat fortnite will come out soon
BlazeThief#4311,My man shroud is playing battlefront 2 to 36k people
J-Klar#4158,He can play a random game and get that many
J-Klar#4158,What a gamer
BlazeThief#4311,Probably the most that games got since release
maximumeffort1#3058,gotta go
J-Klar#4158,Why do you want Fortnite to die lol
maximumeffort1#3058,see ya
BlazeThief#4311,Me or kyle?
J-Klar#4158,Kyle
BlazeThief#4311,We need a new starwars br
J-Klar#4158,I want fortnite to live and become a great game not to die just because it's bad now
maximumeffort1#3058,bye
J-Klar#4158,We need a new starwars rpg / mmo
BlazeThief#4311,I hope it can come back from this but its not looking good especially since like half or more of team liquid is quitting
BlazeThief#4311,and see ya kyl
J-Klar#4158,Sweet revenge
J-Klar#4158,I've been waiting so long for the stick of fish

BlazeThief#4311,Lol tfue using it is just to tease you
J-Klar#4158,He is?
BlazeThief#4311,do you get all the battlefront characters or did shroud just buy them?
J-Klar#4158,I think they made them free
J-Klar#4158,idk
BlazeThief#4311,Pog
J-Klar#4158,Tfue didn't even stream
BlazeThief#4311,Probably since he gets streamsniped ever game

J-Klar#4158,quallied
BlazeThief#4311,ohh

Pizzanat#6176,and almost instant projectile
Pizzanat#6176,so easy 115 damage every time
BlazeThief#4311,i think it was jake or lucas saying something about how theirs are small or lucas was saying his feet were freakishly wide a
BlazeThief#4311,and oooo yeah its pretty good
Pizzanat#6176,i saw kyle's hands
Pizzanat#6176,it is totally real right?

Pizzanat#6176,o
BlazeThief#4311,although i think i was lagging a bit so that may be why

karthiccc#0069,Merak vote in the #deleted-channel
BlazeThief#4311,YOOOOOOOOOO
BlazeThief#4311,Also karthik this is a server for friends and we all post crap in the main one wont it just clutter the server more if we have channels for things like that
karthiccc#0069,"""Not really"
karthiccc#0069,Its just so there aint a spam of links
BlazeThief#4311,i guess thats true but we had stuff like the meme channel where we posted links and stuff like that and it was never really used and everyone just put links and stuff into the main channel though it may be different with a bot
BlazeThief#4311,lets see if the bot works
BlazeThief#4311,or is it not setup yet
Pizzanat#6176,i have no idea
Pizzanat#6176,he just told me to add it and give it permissions
Pizzanat#6176,to delete and send messages
Pizzanat#6176,but he also said he has to set up some more stuff himself as well
J-Klar#4158,Jasper you asked a non yes or no question and wanted a yes or no answer
J-Klar#4158,Twice
J-Klar#4158,Also what is the point in this hot thing. Honestly stupid as heck
Pizzanat#6176,"""Lucas"
BlazeThief#4311,Thats what im saying to be honest i could care less about a bot if you guys care that much i wont post that many links but it dont really see the reason
Pizzanat#6176,"""Also"
BlazeThief#4311,also wahts the point if the bot is going to put the links and stuff into a spam channel
Pizzanat#6176,And only one is not a yes-no question
Pizzanat#6176,Karthik wanted it
Pizzanat#6176,Ask him
BlazeThief#4311,wouldnt that just mean that all the links are going to be lost since no one will check it
BlazeThief#4311,understandable
Pizzanat#6176,Pretty much
BlazeThief#4311,I dont get it
BlazeThief#4311,@J-Klar  check and see if you got the glider i got it
BlazeThief#4311,and it also gave me 800 vbucks
Pizzanat#6176,Do you have enough for the battle pass now?
BlazeThief#4311,yep
BlazeThief#4311,1500
Pizzanat#6176,Nice!
BlazeThief#4311,but ill also want to get some more so ill be closer to getting fishstick
BlazeThief#4311,i can get his pickaxe easily now
Pizzanat#6176,So more storm shield defense....
Pizzanat#6176,?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah probably
BlazeThief#4311,and daily stuff
BlazeThief#4311,i have 3 more ssd at least
BlazeThief#4311,from a tweet from epic it says they will be rolling back the vbucks so ill probably have to do the storm shields just to be safe to get the battlepass
Pizzanat#6176,Fun

J-Klar#4158,You just hit something differently over and over
Lucаs#7263,Oogabooga
Lucаs#7263,No
J-Klar#4158,Name a single other thing you can do other than follow what the game says about a monsters weakness and kill it
J-Klar#4158,You just upgrade shit to keep doing it
Lucаs#7263,Is that not any game? Upgrade your aim in r6 just to kill more people? Oogabooga Jake dumb
Lucаs#7263,It’s just whatever you find satisfying
Lucаs#7263,Clickingnheads
J-Klar#4158,You mean upgrade your aim to actually improve at something skill wise?
Lucаs#7263,Or hitting monsters
J-Klar#4158,There's no skill to m1 mashing
Lucаs#7263,And that’s not how you play the game
J-Klar#4158,Except it is
Pizzanat#6176,There is strategy and skill to it though
J-Klar#4158,m1 spamming on a head and the occasional roll doesn't change how dumb it is
Lucаs#7263,"""You need to know each stun timing"
J-Klar#4158,That's m1 spamming with the occasional m2 and your roll button
Lucаs#7263,It’s not tho go into the harder raids or whatever and see how you do like that
J-Klar#4158,Yeah but to do that I gotta play the game
J-Klar#4158,How long it take to not be crap?
Pizzanat#6176,"""The pike is the mouse click spam"
J-Klar#4158,Combos aint skill tho

Lucаs#7263,So mortal combat isn’t skill?
Pizzanat#6176,"""Tapping your desk is useless in everyway"
Lucаs#7263,That’s about combos
J-Klar#4158,Bruh mortal kombat combos are way different

Pizzanat#6176,What do you mean? I'm not saying anything like that
BlazeThief#4311,i read some of the chat
BlazeThief#4311,if dauntless doesn't get more content it will die soon theres a limited amount of behemoths and once your done i think there is no story left its just grinding for one weapon which is super rare
Pizzanat#6176,they shud have modes where u fight 1 million small guys

BlazeThief#4311,small lads
Pizzanat#6176,yes
BlazeThief#4311,though you can try to get every set maxed so that will take awhile
BlazeThief#4311,but hopefully they will add more content

J-Klar#4158,No I mean comparing doing a simple factoring question to one where m^2 has a coefficent
Pizzanat#6176,"""Well"
Pizzanat#6176,So expect that
J-Klar#4158,Surely the only word questions they'd be useful for is related to quadratics right?
Pizzanat#6176,Yes
J-Klar#4158,Aight that means I woudn't even have to use them then cuz I could just use the formula lol
Pizzanat#6176,Do you not use factoring to solve for x?
J-Klar#4158,fka it's more efficent it's more efficent for me to just remember one way of getting roots lol
J-Klar#4158,You do
J-Klar#4158,But you dont have to
J-Klar#4158,You can always use the formula
Pizzanat#6176,I use factoring mainly :D

BlazeThief#4311,you should have kept it 69
karthiccc#0069,Sadly i am not an intellectual so i completely forgot
Lucаs#7263,"""Can we try Karthik running the server just to see if it’s any better"
BlazeThief#4311,I think its since the server has to render mobs for everyone
BlazeThief#4311,karthiks was worse than yours
BlazeThief#4311,and yours was worse than the realm
BlazeThief#4311,we could try lowering our animal farms or something
Lucаs#7263,i still think its worth a try the realm was just as bad as the other two none were really great but the realm is the only place I had this issue
BlazeThief#4311,i think its too much work to transfer it all back over
BlazeThief#4311,and are you playing solo?
Lucаs#7263,i dont know how you come to that conclusion considering you're doing none of it
BlazeThief#4311,just a jasper thought you know
Lucаs#7263,and it is literally as simple as dragging and dropping a file
Suzuya#4203,We're gonna get lag on any of the servers
Suzuya#4203,Doesn't matter which one
Lucаs#7263,im just saying maybe soke will be less
Suzuya#4203,Especially with all the mass mob farms that most of us have
Lucаs#7263,some
Lucаs#7263,theres no good reason not to at least try
Suzuya#4203,We've tried all of them
Suzuya#4203,And we opt to swap all of them
Suzuya#4203,None of them are better than the other
Lucаs#7263,you dont know that for sure since we have even mopre mobs than before we didnt try karthiks with the amount we have now
BlazeThief#4311,?
Suzuya#4203,It's definitely not gonna make it smoother
BlazeThief#4311,That would make his more laggy than ours wouldnt it?
Lucаs#7263,how about we stop asking and start trying
BlazeThief#4311,Nah
Suzuya#4203,I'm not asking anything
BlazeThief#4311,Also karthik went to Niagara Falls right?
BlazeThief#4311,So he couldnt even do it
Lucаs#7263,k then send it to me Ill allocate all my ram to it and play on a different pc
BlazeThief#4311,if the mob mass is this bad take the game off normal and make it easy to lower it that may help aswel;
Suzuya#4203,It's on easy
BlazeThief#4311,oof
BlazeThief#4311,thought it was normal
Suzuya#4203,IDK why it swapped but it did
BlazeThief#4311,maybe just the default for realms or something?
Suzuya#4203,Probably
Lucаs#7263,its the default for every server
J-Klar#4158,I mean  I'm kinda down
J-Klar#4158,The last film was alright
BlazeThief#4311,Aparently i have to go walk my dog or something with my family

BlazeThief#4311,yeah
J-Klar#4158,Just played with the boys and we're winning so far
BlazeThief#4311,i dont think the game is bad its just id rather solo
J-Klar#4158,Solo the worst do
BlazeThief#4311,jake and the bois
BlazeThief#4311,solo the worst do?
J-Klar#4158,Yeah it sucks
J-Klar#4158,Boring
J-Klar#4158,Duos and trios > squados > solos
BlazeThief#4311,id rather just have access or all modes
BlazeThief#4311,and have the option for solo
J-Klar#4158,Splits the Qs too much
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,but the player base is still pretty big right?
J-Klar#4158,I mean there should be a duos mode but thats about it. Not sure solo would work in a choose your operator game
BlazeThief#4311,yeah true
BlazeThief#4311,but i dont think it should be locked to 3 only
J-Klar#4158,I agree
J-Klar#4158,Most people dont have two friends

Lucаs#7263,I’m selling my gpu today does anyone wanna play some games before the guy comes at 3:30
Lucаs#7263,@everyone
Suzuya#4203,Are you getting a new one or something
Lucаs#7263,yeah but itll take some time to ship it
Suzuya#4203,Get amazon prime b
Lucаs#7263,buying it used off of ebay
Suzuya#4203,Gae
Suzuya#4203,What card
Lucаs#7263,sell 1050 ti for 100 buy rx 480 for 120   $20 out of my pocket for 70% increase in performance
Suzuya#4203,Used online is pretty risky
Lucаs#7263,ebay has a money back gaurentee and the listing is from newegg i think its a used newegg marketplace or something
Suzuya#4203,Understandable
Suzuya#4203,If I replace I’m gonna buy new just in case and because they do degrade overtime
Lucаs#7263,yeah worst case scenario it dies but i mean my card right now cant even play destiny 2 high risk high reward
Suzuya#4203,It might not be just your card cause I only have the 1060 and it can play it just fine on medium high
Lucаs#7263,idk if u have 6gb or 3gb but the different between 1050 ti and 1060 6gb is 80%
Lucаs#7263,i dont get how just one step down can be so much worse
Suzuya#4203,I have the 3gb
Lucаs#7263,74% worse then
Suzuya#4203,Jesus
J-Klar#4158,You must also consider your processor could be holding going back
Lucаs#7263,yeah ofc but still if i get a 480 when i upgrade my processor the 480 is comparable to a  1060 3gb
Lucаs#7263,im also looking into how much it would be to get a new mobo and cpu and either a rx 580 or a 1660
J-Klar#4158,You could spend 200 hundo and get a 6g 1060
Lucаs#7263,why would i not buy a 1660 for 230 tho?
Lucаs#7263,therse one for 330
Lucаs#7263,new as well
J-Klar#4158,I'm not really well acquainted with the 1660 I'm not sure on the performance of the card but for 30 bucks yeah definitely go for that one
J-Klar#4158,Tbf those cards I showed were also new
Lucаs#7263,in between 1060 6gb and 1070
J-Klar#4158,But the only time card are really going to slow down is if used for mining. Buying used is a great idea as long as you ask for proof of the condition of the card
Lucаs#7263,i might just fully upgrade everything because it litereally just costs one paycheck
J-Klar#4158,Yeah don't just upgrade GPU
J-Klar#4158,CPU will throttle performance
J-Klar#4158,Makes it a waste of money
Lucаs#7263,and the i3 9100 is better than most 7th gen i5's
Lucаs#7263,for 140
J-Klar#4158,Oh I've started working out lucas
Lucаs#7263,the main reason i was going for a 480 was just because it was cheap and I wouldnt have to upgrade my processor to get teh best performance but it defenitly wouldnt last as long
Lucаs#7263,nice jake what gym?
J-Klar#4158,Nah not at gym at home. Working on abs shoulders and back rn
Lucаs#7263,nice never thought id hear you say that
J-Klar#4158,Lul
Lucаs#7263,karthik you and I need matching muscle shirts now
Lucаs#7263,for when we go to the school gym
J-Klar#4158,Well I've lost like 24 pounds now figured it was time to activate stage 2
Lucаs#7263,lice up to the name
Lucаs#7263,live*
J-Klar#4158,Yeah living longer than 30 wasn't good enough motivation had to take the mantle of chad
Lucаs#7263,the greatest chad
Lucаs#7263,only problem is that each step up in graphics card is an extra $100 basically
Lucаs#7263,640 for the 1660
Lucаs#7263,530 for the rx 580
Lucаs#7263,430 for the 480
Lucаs#7263,"""with teh extra money i could get a better headset"
Suzuya#4203,Lol I’m gonna get a 9600 and a 2060 because I’m hopefully gonna be doing more full time
Lucаs#7263,nice
Suzuya#4203,Should probably get more ram first tho
Lucаs#7263,yeah its cheap as balls now tho
Suzuya#4203,Yeah definitely a good time
Pizzanat#6176,I want to upgrade to a ryzen 3 3200g and use the integrated graphics on it
Pizzanat#6176,:D
Pizzanat#6176,and then upgrade to 100 tb of storage
Pizzanat#6176,money well spent
Suzuya#4203,Very lame
Pizzanat#6176,Very epic
Pizzanat#6176,also the weather network says that tomorrow will feel like 44 degrees
Pizzanat#6176,yay'
Suzuya#4203,I hope not
J-Klar#4158,He doesn't need more ram lol
J-Klar#4158,8 gb is enough
Suzuya#4203,Not necessarily
Suzuya#4203,8gb is becoming the minimum for a lot of games now
Suzuya#4203,16 being the recommended
J-Klar#4158,Which games?
J-Klar#4158,I don't want to speak for him but he doesn't seem like the type to play single player games
Suzuya#4203,I forget which ones but it won’t go down so better now while it’s cheap
Suzuya#4203,Don’t know when it’s gonna spike again
Suzuya#4203,I was talking about myself for ram upgrades
J-Klar#4158,Well it only spiked because of mobile phones
J-Klar#4158,And I don't think it's going to be going up anymore
Suzuya#4203,Peace of mind at least
J-Klar#4158,"""He should focus on new Cpu and Gpu and headset. I suppose it's always good"
Suzuya#4203,I never said he should
J-Klar#4158,Well you said probably
Suzuya#4203,I’m just gonna start with it because it’s not gonna be at least $500
J-Klar#4158,Well what he wanted to do was gonna be $20 lol
Suzuya#4203,Huh
J-Klar#4158,He said that if he sold is 50ti he could end up getting a 480 for only $20
Suzuya#4203,I was never talking about him for ram smh
J-Klar#4158,Wut
Suzuya#4203,All the upgrades I was talking about were about mine
J-Klar#4158,I know but you told Lucas that he should probably buy ram first
Suzuya#4203,No I said I should
Suzuya#4203,If you look it was right after I was talking about my own upgrades that I’m planning
J-Klar#4158,nevermind I didn't take context
J-Klar#4158,my bad lmao
Suzuya#4203,Smh my head
J-Klar#4158,:(((
J-Klar#4158,Yolo once
Suzuya#4203,4head
J-Klar#4158,No im a stupid 1head
J-Klar#4158,I need to upgrade my CPU too pretty sure it's taking away from my GPU
Lucаs#7263,Just sold it bois $100 is mine
Lucаs#7263,Now I need to think about my options
Lucаs#7263,"""And just play csgo"
Lucаs#7263,This is going to be painful
Lucаs#7263,I need to upgrade cpu as well

Lucаs#7263,I thought maybe double/triple
Suzuya#4203,default random is 20

karthiccc#0069,Kyle.... im an expert
karthiccc#0069,On the subject
karthiccc#0069,Do you want some pointers?
BlazeThief#4311,this new grappling hook operator looks pretty gnarly

Pizzanat#6176,battle pass
Pizzanat#6176,y doh

Pizzanat#6176,season 3 one is all free
Pizzanat#6176,also new grappling hook operator has smg-11 so ez
Pizzanat#6176,"""but then both new characters also have weapons that are already in the game"
Pizzanat#6176,but defender has the vector which is cool!
Pizzanat#6176,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Pizzanat#6176,ok
BlazeThief#4311,ohh the defender looks kinda boring though
BlazeThief#4311,i think the grappling hook will be fun to use
Pizzanat#6176,but looks like it could be useful
Pizzanat#6176,and grappling hook is fun ya
Pizzanat#6176,but probably hard to use in ranked if everyone plays like a team
Pizzanat#6176,and plays properly
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,i dont have to worry about it though
BlazeThief#4311,just play casual

karthiccc#0069,And @Suzuya ill be with DJ so if you want to join us thats fine
Suzuya#4203,Depends on what you’re planning on working but probably
maximumeffort1#3058,Karthick we have science together
maximumeffort1#3058,I dont think i have chem with jesper and jak
Suzuya#4203,You have physics?
Suzuya#4203,Is there general science 11?
maximumeffort1#3058,Ohh you know what i switched physics for chem
karthiccc#0069,Physics is only academic
maximumeffort1#3058,That might be it
Suzuya#4203,If you have physics then we probably have two classes but otherwise just one
maximumeffort1#3058,Yeah i switched it
maximumeffort1#3058,I remember
Suzuya#4203,L
karthiccc#0069,Im switching shit up anyway cuz i dont want english math and physics together sooo
karthiccc#0069,We might get into a similar class
Suzuya#4203,I have physics and math and media studies but I don’t think it’ll be horrible
Suzuya#4203,And my second semester is a cake walk
Pizzanat#6176,My second semester sounds very fun
Pizzanat#6176,"""French"
Pizzanat#6176,"""but oh well"
Pizzanat#6176,I guess
Pizzanat#6176,just a lot of work...................................................
Suzuya#4203,The Asian man
Suzuya#4203,Math is easy but depends on how much homework you get
Pizzanat#6176,Which I'll probably get a lot of from three of those classes
Pizzanat#6176,So that will be fun
Pizzanat#6176,"""Oh also Karthik"
Pizzanat#6176,and then you'll get physics in the second semester
Pizzanat#6176,probably

Suzuya#4203,You’ll see everyone hoarding around it
Suzuya#4203,It’ll be obvious and near the front of the school
BlazeThief#4311,the website said that it will be in between the attendance office and guidance so im not sure
Suzuya#4203,Go through the front door and you should be able to spot it easily
BlazeThief#4311,yeah true

karthiccc#0069,If any of you need a book @J-Klar @Lucаs @Suzuya for your course. I gotchu with this 1150 page full reference book
J-Klar#4158,Or I could use google
J-Klar#4158,You know
J-Klar#4158,The thing with ctrl f
karthiccc#0069,But where the fun in that
J-Klar#4158,Not using an index
karthiccc#0069,Alright whatever
BlazeThief#4311,what language is the course even?
karthiccc#0069,Java
BlazeThief#4311,oooooooooof for me
karthiccc#0069,You takin it?
BlazeThief#4311,i was thinking of taking it but i didnt do the previous one
BlazeThief#4311,so i would probably be confused and behind
karthiccc#0069,There is no previous one
karthiccc#0069,It starts at grade 11
BlazeThief#4311,Lucas said him and jake took it before
karthiccc#0069,Thats a different one
BlazeThief#4311,oh
karthiccc#0069,Yer
karthiccc#0069,You should take it
karthiccc#0069,If you need help you got tech support himself
BlazeThief#4311,will i be okay if i take it with no knowledge though?
karthiccc#0069,100%
karthiccc#0069,its meant to introduce you
karthiccc#0069,its called intro to computer sci for a reason
BlazeThief#4311,alright ill probably take it
BlazeThief#4311,what would the stuff in it even be though
karthiccc#0069,learning how to program
karthiccc#0069,like teh basics
karthiccc#0069,variables
BlazeThief#4311,if it be too hard it might be an L though
karthiccc#0069,if statements
karthiccc#0069,etc
karthiccc#0069,it aint hard merak
karthiccc#0069,you'll be fine
BlazeThief#4311,is it just learning stuff or will we have to do like projects in it and stuff you think
karthiccc#0069,you will have to do small projects
karthiccc#0069,and there is a summative at the end
karthiccc#0069,where you make something
BlazeThief#4311,make an anti spam bot
karthiccc#0069,but I made like a calculator for the summative
BlazeThief#4311,BRUh
karthiccc#0069,its supposed to be something simple
BlazeThief#4311,you made a calculator
karthiccc#0069,yee
BlazeThief#4311,then thats easy
karthiccc#0069,but it does bedmas
BlazeThief#4311,i made one in like 20 minutes in python
karthiccc#0069,yee but you have to make like a GUI
karthiccc#0069,for it
BlazeThief#4311,oh that would be a bit more difficult
karthiccc#0069,yee
BlazeThief#4311,it would teach you about that though right?
karthiccc#0069,there has to be a little more complexity to it to get a higher mark but if your ok with like 80 or 70 then a normal calculator is fine
karthiccc#0069,teach you about what?
BlazeThief#4311,like setting up guis and stuff for it
karthiccc#0069,yeah yeah
karthiccc#0069,its really simple
karthiccc#0069,its drag and drop
BlazeThief#4311,and an 80 is high for me anyways oof
karthiccc#0069,ah I see
karthiccc#0069,well then you'll be fine
karthiccc#0069,there may be a couple tough units but they shouldn't hinder you
BlazeThief#4311,yeah ill most likely take it then then ill be there for 3 classes and can do that one when i get home
karthiccc#0069,yeah exactly
BlazeThief#4311,i should just be able to add it without anything changing aswell id hope
karthiccc#0069,"""yeah"
karthiccc#0069,but apperently they fill up too so might wanna do that quickly
BlazeThief#4311,but wouldnt it just be like a google classroom or something
karthiccc#0069,not really
karthiccc#0069,there is a seperate website for it
karthiccc#0069,on myway
karthiccc#0069,you do all of your stuff there
karthiccc#0069,"""if you have questions for the teacher though"
karthiccc#0069,"""and on like the first day or something if I remember"

Lucаs#7263,"""apearantyl they took the piracy threats really seriously"
Suzuya#4203,Lol
Lucаs#7263,"""and some people were even saying that they have some sort of keylogger that makes sure ur pass and username can't be used on different PC hardware"
Lucаs#7263,and I aint about to pay $90 for it sooo i guess ill just wait
Suzuya#4203,Rip
Suzuya#4203,When is it coming to steam
Lucаs#7263,6 months from now
Suzuya#4203,Yikers
Lucаs#7263,prob be cracked by then tho
Suzuya#4203,I was considering waiting for it to come to steam but 6 months is cringe
Suzuya#4203,I’m probably gonna pick it up
Lucаs#7263,i would for $60 ish CAD but 90 dollars could get me so much better stuff
maximumeffort1#3058,I really dont get it whats so wrong with buying off the epic games store?
Lucаs#7263,i would for $60 ish CAD but 90 dollars could get me so much better stuff
maximumeffort1#3058,All triple A titles go for 90 what do you expect
Lucаs#7263,"""not to pay the same about of money for a game as I would pay for 16 gigs of ram"
Lucаs#7263,all of those would enhance gameplay experience in every game
Lucаs#7263,vs just getting one more
maximumeffort1#3058,Id rather just enjoy a game than waste my time with that
Lucаs#7263,hard to enjoy a game when ur specs are under hte min requirements tho or when you take forever to load because you dont have enough stoage on SSD
maximumeffort1#3058,The only game for me that takes longer to load is rainbow
Lucаs#7263,min specs as well?
Lucаs#7263,have fun at 720p 30fps

karthiccc#0069,i cant open any of them and the type of file doesnt exist
karthiccc#0069,i cant delete them either because the computer cant figure out what they are'
karthiccc#0069,fucking windows didnt even exist back then

Suzuya#4203,@karthiccc @Lucаs instantaneous acceleration is found the same way as instantaneous velocity right?
karthiccc#0069,Correct @Suzuya
Suzuya#4203,dang
Suzuya#4203,i just finished the velocity graph its so tedious
karthiccc#0069,ik
karthiccc#0069,have fun
karthiccc#0069,you still got the areas for the second graph too
karthiccc#0069,thats also very very tedious
Suzuya#4203,did yours look similar to this?
karthiccc#0069,Mine looked more like this
karthiccc#0069,It levels out at the end cuz the line becomes linear
Suzuya#4203,i guess it could vary from the points we chose but yours dips really hard
karthiccc#0069,true but my y axis increases by .1 soooooo
Suzuya#4203,question 1 is done
Suzuya#4203,do you need an acceleration time graph for question  2?
Lucаs#7263,Yes
Lucаs#7263,No
karthiccc#0069,nope
Lucаs#7263,No
Suzuya#4203,you dont need a graph but do i think you need to find it still right?
karthiccc#0069,well not nessecarily
Lucаs#7263,No
Lucаs#7263,Just find d/t graph
Suzuya#4203,you need acceleration to calculate d tho dont you
Lucаs#7263,No I use the area trick
Lucаs#7263,U
Lucаs#7263,Not the formula
Suzuya#4203,i thought the formula was the area trick
Lucаs#7263,You should be able to calculate the area without acceleration
Suzuya#4203,alrighty
karthiccc#0069,yee yee
Lucаs#7263,Karrhik join call

J-Klar#4158,Is that right?
J-Klar#4158,I believe so
karthiccc#0069,uuuuuuuuuuuh
karthiccc#0069,what was teh velocity-time graph you used?
karthiccc#0069,yeah how did you get the acceleration graph then?
karthiccc#0069,i have basically the same graph as you
J-Klar#4158,Took that and used tangents from it to get accel points
J-Klar#4158,Because you have to
J-Klar#4158,Not supposed to use formula
karthiccc#0069,your supposed to use formula
J-Klar#4158,Nu uh
karthiccc#0069,YES
karthiccc#0069,a = vf - vi / tf - ti
J-Klar#4158,Im aware but on the sheet it only ever mentions using tangents
karthiccc#0069,only ever?
karthiccc#0069,what you tryna say
J-Klar#4158,Only mentions that tangents no formula...
karthiccc#0069,YOU GOTTA USE THE FORMULA
J-Klar#4158,It literally only says to use tangents lol
karthiccc#0069,bro that aint how it work
J-Klar#4158,Yes it is lol
Suzuya#4203,@Lucаs do you have the math note from today?
karthiccc#0069,gucci belt on while im fucking my sister

BlazeThief#4311,bruh they adding bots to fortnite
BlazeThief#4311,like realm royale has
BlazeThief#4311,litterally just ai that dies
Lucаs#7263,Said who
BlazeThief#4311,epic games
Lucаs#7263,Cringe
BlazeThief#4311,also the black ops story ended with them killing all the characters
BlazeThief#4311,i am depression
BlazeThief#4311,literally everyone died
Lucаs#7263,Not the bus driver on transit
BlazeThief#4311,no he died
Lucаs#7263,Because he is robocop
BlazeThief#4311,the main characters all died
BlazeThief#4311,to stop the cycle in the story
BlazeThief#4311,and it destroyed everything in the worlds
BlazeThief#4311,so everything is gone
Lucаs#7263,How are they gonna make a new game off of that
BlazeThief#4311,Its the end of the story
Lucаs#7263,Wdym
BlazeThief#4311,it was the aether story with the 4 main guys
BlazeThief#4311,and its the end of their storyline now
BlazeThief#4311,this was their last map
Lucаs#7263,Like rictofen?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
Lucаs#7263,Dude this is the end of an era
BlazeThief#4311,a decade of games
Lucаs#7263,Literally
Lucаs#7263,Man that is sad
BlazeThief#4311,and it was a real bittersweet ending
Lucаs#7263,Dude that sucks ass
BlazeThief#4311,the characters were all happy in the end and died in their sleep by nicolai poisoning them
BlazeThief#4311,but they all died and theres a low chance theres going to be any more games with the characters
BlazeThief#4311,and apparently treyarc was on a low budget so all the cutscenes were kinda crappy
Lucаs#7263,Oof
BlazeThief#4311,Oof indeed

Lucаs#7263,Hellos
Suzuya#4203,aye whos done the physics homework and wants to help explain to my dumbass?
BlazeThief#4311,thats going to be me when i have to do it
Suzuya#4203,are you gonna take physics?
BlazeThief#4311,are there other options?
Suzuya#4203,you dont need more than the two general sciences to pass
BlazeThief#4311,then im yoinking those and dipping
Suzuya#4203,idk if ur thinking about post secondary
BlazeThief#4311,i have no idea what im going to do still
Suzuya#4203,lol
BlazeThief#4311,anything computer science needs higher science im guessing though right
Suzuya#4203,computer science is any higher science with physics being preferred
BlazeThief#4311,dang
BlazeThief#4311,is that for 11 and 12
BlazeThief#4311,or could i take 12 and be okay
BlazeThief#4311,if there is even one for that
Suzuya#4203,11 physics is a prerequisite for grade 12
BlazeThief#4311,dang
BlazeThief#4311,ill have to see then
Suzuya#4203,you could take them in back to back semesters
BlazeThief#4311,thats true
BlazeThief#4311,if i do end up taking it ill probably end up doing that
BlazeThief#4311,ill see how i feel about it after this elearning course
Suzuya#4203,lol
BlazeThief#4311,I might see if i can do something with graphic design or something though
BlazeThief#4311,just gotta get better at it first
Suzuya#4203,i wish it was earlier for me because idk if ill want to take it in grade 12 but ill only have like a week in it to base it off of
Suzuya#4203,and class changes are a pain in the ass
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,my dad just talked to them
BlazeThief#4311,so i didnt have to do anything 5000 iq
Suzuya#4203,tbh i stared at the physics question for like 20+ minutes and gave up ill ask him to explain it tomorrow
Suzuya#4203,he probably will anyway
BlazeThief#4311,oof
karthiccc#0069,Computer science doesnt need any science prerequisites vut you need really REALLY good grades in math for it
karthiccc#0069,Like average for computer science is 95% in math
BlazeThief#4311,oh lord
karthiccc#0069,And for waterloo thats more like 99%

BlazeThief#4311,I aint playing it much right now
BlazeThief#4311,because my pc runs it like poo
BlazeThief#4311,ill probably put the better stuff in my pc soon so ill play then
Lucаs#7263,wow i c how it is
J-Klar#4158,Bruh lol anime?
BlazeThief#4311,no its just an animated series
BlazeThief#4311,though they got a phat anime orchestra director for their animations before so maybe epic music
BlazeThief#4311,I've truly ascended
karthiccc#0069,wait whats an animated series?
BlazeThief#4311,this is the trailer
karthiccc#0069,Yo that actually looks sick
BlazeThief#4311,yeah its going to be gnarly
karthiccc#0069,But like isnt it technically individual stories for each person?
karthiccc#0069,So how long are they planning to make this
BlazeThief#4311,its a whole actual world though
BlazeThief#4311,and its probably going to revolve around characters that aren't in the game and have characters from the game join them
BlazeThief#4311,or fight them or something
karthiccc#0069,Ah i see
karthiccc#0069,I guess we'll just have to wait and see
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
karthiccc#0069,But like what are they putting it out on? Netflix?
BlazeThief#4311,not sure
BlazeThief#4311,have to wait and see more info
karthiccc#0069,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,but they also making a fighting game
BlazeThief#4311,and theres rumors that they make a mmo aswell
karthiccc#0069,Riot?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
karthiccc#0069,Hmmmm
karthiccc#0069,Could be interesting
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,they have a league card game aswell like hearthstone but more f2p friendly
karthiccc#0069,Yeah i heard of it
karthiccc#0069,But it looks boring
BlazeThief#4311,L
karthiccc#0069,My opinion
BlazeThief#4311,yeah i dont know if id play it all too often but it looks like something random to play
karthiccc#0069,Yea i guess
Suzuya#4203,@BlazeThief
Suzuya#4203,"""yo"
Lucаs#7263,Honestly I’d check out a league mmo
karthiccc#0069,6quid9ard
karthiccc#0069,Now this
BlazeThief#4311,i remember reading that in like grade 5
karthiccc#0069,Shit was lit
Lucаs#7263,Dude i actually remember that too
Lucаs#7263,Forgot about it completely
BlazeThief#4311,same
BlazeThief#4311,i forget the entire plot of it
BlazeThief#4311,remember there were the main guys and an old lady
karthiccc#0069,Hopefully netflix makes it good id love to have a nostalgia trip
Suzuya#4203,@BlazeThief hop on
BlazeThief#4311,just play a solo game or something i have to help clean
BlazeThief#4311,im going to get the stuff in my pc so ill probably join after thats done

karthiccc#0069,Election
BlazeThief#4311,i got those new parts in my pc bois
BlazeThief#4311,i loaded my pc up this morning and it only took like 5 seconds before it would take like 40 to a minute
Suzuya#4203,@BlazeThief use those sick load times to load league
BlazeThief#4311,my siege download speed is almost 100 mb per second
BlazeThief#4311,@Lucаs  join the call sir
Lucаs#7263,I’m afking in d2 haven’t been playing since 12:00
BlazeThief#4311,oh lord
BlazeThief#4311,how are you even afk
karthiccc#0069,by being gay
BlazeThief#4311,L
BlazeThief#4311,mobile
BlazeThief#4311,?
Lucаs#7263,yeye dawg
karthiccc#0069,Gay scale:
karthiccc#0069,Sharing Fortnite win
karthiccc#0069,Lucas at the top already damn
karthiccc#0069,Talk about leveling up eh?
J-Klar#4158,I love how Lucas finds a  reason to AFK in literally every game he plays
BlazeThief#4311,literally ruining games for people to afk
Lucаs#7263,"""but enhancing the game for me"
Suzuya#4203,the selfishness shines through
BlazeThief#4311,only reported once that you know of
Lucаs#7263,if they dont wanna play with me they can leave
BlazeThief#4311,probably got reported like a million times
BlazeThief#4311,what did you guys do for the e learning
BlazeThief#4311,loop thing for this week
J-Klar#4158,I did what it asked me to?
J-Klar#4158,Do you want a sc?
karthiccc#0069,Merak just: 
karthiccc#0069,Ez
J-Klar#4158,nah he wants us to do the most scuffed ting
karthiccc#0069,```While (true){
karthiccc#0069,EZ
BlazeThief#4311,yes please
BlazeThief#4311,@J-Klar
J-Klar#4158,aight gimme a sec
BlazeThief#4311,the site for the work is so scuffed
karthiccc#0069,Dont be rude
karthiccc#0069,The cite is doing its best
BlazeThief#4311,nah
karthiccc#0069,Yah
BlazeThief#4311,the cite is doing its best the teacher making the cite is not
karthiccc#0069,Thats better
karthiccc#0069,Respect
J-Klar#4158,Wait what site?
J-Klar#4158,@MERAK
BlazeThief#4311,the main one for this weeks work
J-Klar#4158,?
J-Klar#4158,For like the array thing? cuz i haven't looked at that yet
BlazeThief#4311,no the loops
J-Klar#4158,what site then lul
BlazeThief#4311,everything is pushed to the side
J-Klar#4158,Oh you mean the formatting
J-Klar#4158,Like on the content page?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
J-Klar#4158,Yeah it was broken as fuck
BlazeThief#4311,its weird
BlazeThief#4311,half the parts were supposed to look at are too small to see
BlazeThief#4311,and thanks for the sc
J-Klar#4158,yeye
BlazeThief#4311,@J-Klar  did you make it so your program makes re opens the menu after its done the task
BlazeThief#4311,like if it did the number squared then it would show the number and then open the menu again
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
J-Klar#4158,You have to
BlazeThief#4311,how did you do it which part of the sc was it
J-Klar#4158,First one and last one
J-Klar#4158,I created an option called exit for it
J-Klar#4158,And if that one is chosen only then can the program be closed
BlazeThief#4311,oh is it when i = 1 then it will show the menu
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,and you set it to 1 at the end of the task
BlazeThief#4311,okay
J-Klar#4158,Ye
BlazeThief#4311,do we have to do the exponent thing for the first one
J-Klar#4158,Except for the quit option where it gets turned off and stays that way meaning the program closes
J-Klar#4158,What do you mean?
BlazeThief#4311,like you have it like when (exponent != 0)
BlazeThief#4311,what if we just made the the number the user input just times it by itself
J-Klar#4158,"""Well you could"
BlazeThief#4311,alright
BlazeThief#4311,thanks
J-Klar#4158,Also make sure to consider that the exponent needs to be equal to one less of what you would think it would be. For example with the squaring the exponent is actually equal to one as it runs the multiplication on itself once (squaring).
J-Klar#4158,But you'd presume the exponent would be a 2
J-Klar#4158,And with cubes it 2 and so on
BlazeThief#4311,wait what
J-Klar#4158,while(exponent != 0) { value = base * value; exponent --;}
J-Klar#4158,So to square you would have to run this code once
J-Klar#4158,Meaning that the value to give exponent has to be 1 and not 2
J-Klar#4158,Because once it does th emultiplication it subtracts 1 from the value of exponent (1 - 1 = 0) the code doesn't run again
BlazeThief#4311,oh so you just subtract so it doesnt run again
J-Klar#4158,If exponent was given a value of 2 it would run the first time squaring the number then exponent would be 1 (2 - 1 = 1) and because 1 != 0 it will run once again
BlazeThief#4311,but if i just do
BlazeThief#4311,num = keyboard.nextInt();
BlazeThief#4311,{
BlazeThief#4311,wouldnt that just work
J-Klar#4158,"""It would for squaring yes and for the cubing one"
BlazeThief#4311,do you think he will care
BlazeThief#4311,if we have consistency?
J-Klar#4158,Idk
J-Klar#4158,I just like it and it's good practice
J-Klar#4158,Considering the assignment kinda asks you to do the whole thing using loops
J-Klar#4158,Like we aren't practicing giving numbers powers we are practicing using loops
BlazeThief#4311,true
J-Klar#4158,So you would probably get a worse grade
BlazeThief#4311,but its kinda aids to use loops here
BlazeThief#4311,and doesnt he always talk about programmers using ways to make things easier for themselves
J-Klar#4158,"""I guess"
BlazeThief#4311,yeah i guess
karthiccc#0069,Programmer go the lazy way merak never the easy way
BlazeThief#4311,dang
BlazeThief#4311,whats the lazy way
karthiccc#0069,Whatever you typed first
karthiccc#0069,If it work
karthiccc#0069,Dont touch it
BlazeThief#4311,but they actually want us to do loops so i cant do it
karthiccc#0069,Whats the project?
BlazeThief#4311,here i can screen shot it
karthiccc#0069,Ight
J-Klar#4158,Yikes Merak if you disliked the other thing you'll hate the next project
J-Klar#4158,Literally had to go out of my way to make simple code more convuluded just to include loops
BlazeThief#4311,bruh
BlazeThief#4311,ill try and get a head start on that tomorrow then
BlazeThief#4311,so i dont have to do it late
BlazeThief#4311,but if we can use another method why should we use loops if its more difficult to implement
J-Klar#4158,No clue
J-Klar#4158,It literally just means more work for the same results
BlazeThief#4311,does it say it has to use loops?
BlazeThief#4311,if not im going to not use them
karthiccc#0069,```While (True){
karthiccc#0069,I forgot how to do some specific stuff but the basic idea is the same
karthiccc#0069,Should work with a little debugging
J-Klar#4158,You have to
J-Klar#4158,Otherwise I wouldn't be lol
karthiccc#0069,I have to what?
BlazeThief#4311,would what karthik sent be okay to use though
BlazeThief#4311,are case 1 and 2 even loops
karthiccc#0069,Thats a switch case function
karthiccc#0069,Learnt it yet?
J-Klar#4158,No they are a different way of using if statements
J-Klar#4158,The loop he uses is pretty much the exact same I used
BlazeThief#4311,ive seen them but i dont think we have really used them yet
karthiccc#0069,Im pretty sure he wouldnt mind
J-Klar#4158,"""Our code is pretty much the same"
karthiccc#0069,Merak its not a hard program
karthiccc#0069,Whats the issue?
J-Klar#4158,Toxic
karthiccc#0069,Me?
BlazeThief#4311,just confused a bit with the squared stuff on as how to write it
karthiccc#0069,For squared judt do number × number
karthiccc#0069,For cubed: number × number × number
BlazeThief#4311,but doesnt it have to be a loop
BlazeThief#4311,so i cant just do number x number
karthiccc#0069,Does it for those?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,all of them have to be
karthiccc#0069,Fod jeez fine
karthiccc#0069,Fine
BlazeThief#4311,thats why its annoying
karthiccc#0069,Ill give you a program that only uses loops
J-Klar#4158,Just use what I gave you Merak?
J-Klar#4158,Da hek
BlazeThief#4311,but isnt that copying and he will see
J-Klar#4158,Change it up a lil bit then
J-Klar#4158,There really can't be too much variation in one project
J-Klar#4158,Considering using loops is pointless and just leads to the same convuleded outcome in this case
BlazeThief#4311,yeah true
karthiccc#0069,You would use a loop for cubed and past
karthiccc#0069,But a loop for squared is retarded
J-Klar#4158,Ye
J-Klar#4158,Because you only run it once omeglul
karthiccc#0069,Even cubed is redundent to use a loop
karthiccc#0069,But i mean
karthiccc#0069,If he says you should do it
karthiccc#0069,Then do it
BlazeThief#4311,its a big yikes from me dog
karthiccc#0069,Whatever you say dog
BlazeThief#4311,how was the voting thing
J-Klar#4158,Bank worthy
J-Klar#4158,Alright I did the array assignment
J-Klar#4158,I ended up using loops somewhere else so I got rid of them for assigning values to my array elements to make it less scuffed
J-Klar#4158,"""Merak if you need to look at it for help"
karthiccc#0069,Gay arrays
karthiccc#0069,Use vectors retard
Suzuya#4203,y'all ready for the test tomorrow?
J-Klar#4158,yeye
Suzuya#4203,for 17 in the review the net force is 0 right?
J-Klar#4158,idk didn't do it
Suzuya#4203,yknow
J-Klar#4158,yeah just looked at and yeah it would be
J-Klar#4158,cuz gravity and normal force cancel each other out
Suzuya#4203,because its at rest
J-Klar#4158,Ye
Suzuya#4203,just got a third monitor hype :A_:
Suzuya#4203,@BlazeThief you playing?

Suzuya#4203,???
karthiccc#0069,"""Gravity"
karthiccc#0069,Might need to memorize some facts about them
karthiccc#0069,They were on my sisters old test
karthiccc#0069,"""Like if they are an attraction force or repulsive"
karthiccc#0069,Whatever we wrote down in the note
Suzuya#4203,i wish he'd give us a list of what we'll need
karthiccc#0069,Yeah but he didnt so just gotta be prepared for everything

Lucаs#7263,yeah its super easy but theres an error in it
BlazeThief#4311,oof
BlazeThief#4311,the show what you know looks annoying
Lucаs#7263,yeah it wont be too bad tho
BlazeThief#4311,what do you think you will do for it
Lucаs#7263,"""im gonna do a program that calculates the cost of buying 5 items seperatly vs buying them together"
BlazeThief#4311,dang smart play there
Lucаs#7263,but the one that just creates 10 random values and outputs the max/min woudl be super easy
BlazeThief#4311,which one>
BlazeThief#4311,?
Lucаs#7263,"""Create a program that will create an array of 10 random math/science/etc. questions"

Lucаs#7263,wait nvm the second is the one i was talking about
BlazeThief#4311,the one your doing?
Lucаs#7263,no the one with the max/min values
BlazeThief#4311,wouldnt the 5 assignment mark average be easy aswell
BlazeThief#4311,though its kinda gross to add loops to some stuff
Lucаs#7263,yeah it would be

Lucаs#7263,a variable that never changes
BlazeThief#4311,oh alright
BlazeThief#4311,how would you add a loop to that though
Lucаs#7263,use teh loop to ask for the marks
BlazeThief#4311,like it keeps looping until the input 5 marks
Lucаs#7263,yeah they show u how to do that in the lesson
BlazeThief#4311,in this one
BlazeThief#4311,or the last one?

J-Klar#4158,@CAMERON For part 2 we get the acceleration from the slope of the velocity graphs right?
karthiccc#0069,Yes
J-Klar#4158,thought so
J-Klar#4158,wait please don't tell me we have to use tangents to get the velocity time graph
J-Klar#4158,or can we just use big 5 number 1
karthiccc#0069,n0
karthiccc#0069,watch the fucking video you cunt

J-Klar#4158,fucker
karthiccc#0069,i still love you
J-Klar#4158,me 2

karthiccc#0069,every single weight and for each trial of every weight
karthiccc#0069,so 12 graphs
J-Klar#4158,thats me graphing

BlazeThief#4311,@J-Klar
BlazeThief#4311,is there even work for this week
BlazeThief#4311,o wait nevermind
BlazeThief#4311,looked at the wrong page
Suzuya#4203,Bruh Aphelios takes a PhD in game design to learn
Pizzanat#6176,but arjoon is not about that high life
Pizzanat#6176,he is all about the drinking
Suzuya#4203,Also @karthiccc have you done the physics review?
karthiccc#0069,Boy im at the gym i didnt even touch that yet minus what i did in class
Suzuya#4203,Kinda cringe
Suzuya#4203,I got it done I just wanna check my answers I’ll message you after I’m done work
karthiccc#0069,Ight
BlazeThief#4311,he has a whole new hud
BlazeThief#4311,and has like 5 weapons
Suzuya#4203,Ik
Suzuya#4203,I read the whole thing
BlazeThief#4311,im kinda confused on his kit still
Suzuya#4203,New aphelios main btw
BlazeThief#4311,aphelios mid
BlazeThief#4311,his in game looks kinda cringe though
Suzuya#4203,It’s weird he has pretty much no w or e
BlazeThief#4311,yeah he cant upgrade stuff
BlazeThief#4311,it just goes into stats
BlazeThief#4311,wonder what his builds will be since he can auto upgrade stuff
Suzuya#4203,Wdym
BlazeThief#4311,they said since he auto gets abilities and upgrades them
Suzuya#4203,Yeah ik
BlazeThief#4311,you choose a stat to upgrade instead
Suzuya#4203,I don’t think you choose it
BlazeThief#4311,i think one of them was ad or attack speed
BlazeThief#4311,here
Suzuya#4203,It might auto go into them
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
Suzuya#4203,Like a little bit of everything
BlazeThief#4311,i wonder how much they will get buffed
BlazeThief#4311,his win rate will probably be poo
Suzuya#4203,Probably a couple percent
BlazeThief#4311,since people wont know how to use him
Suzuya#4203,It’ll be really bad and probably stay a little under 50
Suzuya#4203,Once the people start maiming him
Suzuya#4203,Maining
BlazeThief#4311,someone was saying that he will have the lowest
BlazeThief#4311,then theyll buff him and he'll be op
Suzuya#4203,He’s legit there to make comp more interesting
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,i think the next champ is supposed to be a juggernaut they said
Suzuya#4203,He’ll probably a phat buff before worlds
BlazeThief#4311,i just want to see how he actually plays in game
BlazeThief#4311,since he looks like he will either be epic gamer or not epic gamer
BlazeThief#4311,he kinda reminds me of jhin
BlazeThief#4311,since he looks immobile
Suzuya#4203,He’s like if jinxes q was turned into a whole character
BlazeThief#4311,yeah i wonder how much his mana cost will be
Suzuya#4203,I mean he only has 2 abilities
BlazeThief#4311,but youll probably be switching between weapons a decent ammount
Suzuya#4203,But they said something cost mana I forget what
Suzuya#4203,I don’t think switching weapons cost mana
BlazeThief#4311,his q definitely will
BlazeThief#4311,well have to see about the w
Suzuya#4203,It depends how much you use his q
Suzuya#4203,W will be probably none and if any it’ll be tiny
BlazeThief#4311,just make it 1 like kass w
J-Klar#4158,@Lucаs and @CAMERON Am done the study sheet if u wanna check answers or what not
J-Klar#4158,though yall be fine it gets super easy after the pendulum

J-Klar#4158,if height is 16 and gravity is 9.81
J-Klar#4158,meaning you get the sqr root of 15.6.96
J-Klar#4158,which is 12.5
J-Klar#4158,so double that would be 25?
karthiccc#0069,sqrt(2(9.81)(15.6))
karthiccc#0069,is 17.5
karthiccc#0069,rounded
J-Klar#4158,Karthik if you're gonna watch through the vid can u make like a summary of important points
karthiccc#0069,bruh nah

karthiccc#0069,what did you get for it?
Suzuya#4203,i didnt understand the wuestion
karthiccc#0069,oh
karthiccc#0069,alright
karthiccc#0069,so you have to figure out what the perceived Frequency is
karthiccc#0069,you know that the difference between the actual frequency and the percieved is 58
karthiccc#0069,it now depends on whether the fire truck is approaching or leaving the observer
karthiccc#0069,i said that the fire truck is approaching
karthiccc#0069,so it would be 450hz + 58hz = frequency percieved
karthiccc#0069,use that and tell me what you get
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat seige?
Pizzanat#6176,not yet
Lucаs#7263,aight
Pizzanat#6176,ok sure

Aho#7784,@Pizzanat
Aho#7784,@Pizzanat
Pizzanat#6176,@Aho
Aho#7784,how do you find the percentage of a hydrate?
Pizzanat#6176,get the molar mass of the whole thing
Pizzanat#6176,get just the water molecules
Pizzanat#6176,including how much the coefficient is
Aho#7784,MM of water?
Pizzanat#6176,yes
Aho#7784,ok got it
karthiccc#0069,H20 atoms / total atoms × 100%
karthiccc#0069,Ez
Pizzanat#6176,and then do the basic percent stuff you know
Pizzanat#6176,"""we don't use atoms for this"
Aho#7784,MM H2O/total MM X 100
Pizzanat#6176,pretty much
Pizzanat#6176,and you have the percent that is water
Pizzanat#6176,and if you want the anhydrous salt
Pizzanat#6176,then use the molar mass of just the salt
Pizzanat#6176,instead of water
Pizzanat#6176,got it?
Aho#7784,yep
Aho#7784,thank
Aho#7784,you
Pizzanat#6176,just don't forget
Pizzanat#6176,"""if it is 5H2O"
Aho#7784,yeah Ik
Pizzanat#6176,ok have fun
Aho#7784,wait always 90?
Pizzanat#6176,close to it
Pizzanat#6176,MM of H2O is close to 18
Pizzanat#6176,so 18 x 5
Aho#7784,oh I thought you meant it will be 50 exactly
Pizzanat#6176,it won't
Pizzanat#6176,MM of H2O is 18.0153 g/mol
Aho#7784,no I misread the question
Pizzanat#6176,so 5H2O is 90.0765 g/mol
Aho#7784,okok
J-Klar#4158,what question were you erven talkingabout
J-Klar#4158,like where does it ask for the percentage of water
Aho#7784,Question 7 multiple choice
J-Klar#4158,oh lol
J-Klar#4158,yeah just take mm of the hydrate and divide by total
Aho#7784,yeah brain is not working rn
J-Klar#4158,gonna have another pvnrt issue
Aho#7784,NO
Aho#7784,NEVER AGAIN
Aho#7784,I made sure it was right

Suzuya#4203,@karthiccc @Lucаs @J-Klar have any of you done 13 yet im really stupid
karthiccc#0069,what temp did you get?
Suzuya#4203,how do you rearrange
karthiccc#0069,divide both sides by 1536hz
Suzuya#4203,join vc
karthiccc#0069,"""@Suzuya when I use -38"
karthiccc#0069,so i think that is right
Suzuya#4203,Maybe I got the numbers mixed up
karthiccc#0069,could be
Suzuya#4203,I was using 1425 as emitted I thought that was it
karthiccc#0069,lol
BlazeThief#4311,looking at these e learning things
BlazeThief#4311,and the last 3 weeks
BlazeThief#4311,we havent done any programming
BlazeThief#4311,its all reports
BlazeThief#4311,ez games
J-Klar#4158,@KARTHIK 1425 is the emitted though
J-Klar#4158,And using that and the logic that the person is hearing a higher frequency that means that the train is moving towards the person and as such in the formula the vobject would be negative and when you do all this it ends with 40 degrees celcius
J-Klar#4158,So im confused
J-Klar#4158,Like Im not really sure why you got 1536 as emitted when the question literally says that 1425 was emitted lul
karthiccc#0069,Bruh i switched the numbers by accident
karthiccc#0069,Fuck
karthiccc#0069,Im retarded
karthiccc#0069,"""Ah whatever"
J-Klar#4158,No
karthiccc#0069,Just the numbers were wrong
J-Klar#4158,your equation needs to have the v object negative
karthiccc#0069,Yeah yeah i know now
J-Klar#4158,aight
karthiccc#0069,Dumb mistake
karthiccc#0069,Thanks for pointing it out tho
J-Klar#4158,was gonna say that while im usually wrong about things i was like actually super confused lmao
J-Klar#4158,Going over these questions this test is gonna be really easy....
karthiccc#0069,Yee dont forget to memorize the essay tho
karthiccc#0069,That gonna be shit
J-Klar#4158,Well I mean is that gonna be on this test. He only said he likes to put them on the exam
karthiccc#0069,True but there could be a chance
J-Klar#4158,true true
J-Klar#4158,I know like the basic outline
karthiccc#0069,Then you should be set
J-Klar#4158,and we still have monday so pog
karthiccc#0069,Exactly
karthiccc#0069,Shouldnt be a hard test thats for sure
J-Klar#4158,famous last words
Suzuya#4203,for 13
Suzuya#4203,works out to 332.1
Suzuya#4203,which is like 1 degree c
Suzuya#4203,sigfigs brings it to -2
karthiccc#0069,Where did you get this?
Suzuya#4203,math papa
Suzuya#4203,i just plugged in the equation with x as vsound
karthiccc#0069,Hmmmm
karthiccc#0069,I dunno
karthiccc#0069,At this point lets just ask him tomorrow
Suzuya#4203,it works
Suzuya#4203,330
Suzuya#4203,you have to put the numbers in first but it works out good
Suzuya#4203,vi stands for viscous
J-Klar#4158,Yeah no that website is awful lol
Suzuya#4203,but it worked
J-Klar#4158,Just tried the same equation written two different ways and it gives different answers
Suzuya#4203,ur just bad
J-Klar#4158,Also I used it and got an answer that it also says works so...
J-Klar#4158,Also it yours is wrong no matter what because it needs to be 0.606x - 24 not add
Suzuya#4203,i swapped itr and it worked still
Suzuya#4203,ur too salty what did math papa do to hurt you
J-Klar#4158,Yeah thats my point lmao
J-Klar#4158,You swapped it and it just worked
J-Klar#4158,tf lol?
Suzuya#4203,yeah because it just changes from negative to positive
Suzuya#4203,thats how algebra works
J-Klar#4158,not with siggy figgies
Suzuya#4203,i did it myself with sigfigs the same way and it works
Suzuya#4203,it was 2 different
J-Klar#4158,Risk it for the biscuit
Suzuya#4203,i did and got the right answer
J-Klar#4158,wat u get
Suzuya#4203,330
Suzuya#4203,-2 degrees
J-Klar#4158,Yeah see I got like 0.48235
Suzuya#4203,did you reverse calculate?
Suzuya#4203,sigfigs for 330
J-Klar#4158,You're doing it a really weird way
J-Klar#4158,I guess the way you're doing it is techincally better though
Suzuya#4203,tf are you doing
J-Klar#4158,x reps the temp
Suzuya#4203,just find vsound
Suzuya#4203,and reverse the formula
J-Klar#4158,I mean this way is faster
J-Klar#4158,STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
Suzuya#4203,and a lot more numbers with the chance of messing up
J-Klar#4158,tbf karthik did what I did too
J-Klar#4158,Ill be 100% honest I didn't even think of doing it your way
Suzuya#4203,plug in -2.3
Suzuya#4203,works out big brain styles
J-Klar#4158,Yeah the other way is wacko mode
Suzuya#4203,idk why urs doesnt work out
J-Klar#4158,neither
J-Klar#4158,it should
J-Klar#4158,but it doesn't
J-Klar#4158,Yeah I get 1.16849 degrees
Suzuya#4203,yeah same idk
Suzuya#4203,thats what it is without sigfigs
karthiccc#0069,SO WHAT IS THE FUCKING ANSWER?
Suzuya#4203,its -2
karthiccc#0069,Alright
karthiccc#0069,Wait even with sigfigs?
Suzuya#4203,thats with sigfigs
Suzuya#4203,without its 1.16
karthiccc#0069,Wait would you round up?
Suzuya#4203,???
Suzuya#4203,wym
karthiccc#0069,Its 1.16 right?
karthiccc#0069,For 1 sig fig that would go down to just 1
Suzuya#4203,thats without sigfigs at all
Suzuya#4203,the final answer is -2
karthiccc#0069,Wait
Suzuya#4203,maybe -2.3
karthiccc#0069,Bruh you confusing me
Suzuya#4203,vc
karthiccc#0069,Nah imma go to sleep
karthiccc#0069,Just show me at school
Suzuya#4203,u dumb
karthiccc#0069,Probably
karthiccc#0069,Most likely
J-Klar#4158,Makes the answer was 1

karthiccc#0069,He said that it might be on the test
Suzuya#4203,what about them?
Suzuya#4203,the examples? effects at whatever level or all of it?
J-Klar#4158,I presume effects at the levels
J-Klar#4158,I don't really think he cares if we can remember that a shotgun blast to the ears bursts an ear drum
J-Klar#4158,or myabe hes into that
karthiccc#0069,he might want examples

Lucаs#7263,@BlazeThief darwin
Lucаs#7263,?
BlazeThief#4311,hop in
BlazeThief#4311,call
BlazeThief#4311,Whats some good affordable keyboards bois @everyone
BlazeThief#4311,mines starting to wear down stop responding
Aho#7784,What kind of keyboard do you want and what’s your budget?
BlazeThief#4311,Probably mechanical and around 100 i guess
BlazeThief#4311,lower would be good
BlazeThief#4311,but id rather one that would last for more
BlazeThief#4311,so ill pay a bit more
Aho#7784,Can a 60% keyboard do fine?
BlazeThief#4311,what 60% mean?
BlazeThief#4311,like no numpad?
BlazeThief#4311,Id rather it be bigger
Aho#7784,How about a numberless keyboard?
BlazeThief#4311,like no numpad?
Aho#7784,Yeah
Aho#7784,Or do you like using those
BlazeThief#4311,that could be good
BlazeThief#4311,i dont use mine
BlazeThief#4311,i kinda want to get one that has a volume slider though
BlazeThief#4311,since i use that on mine alot
Aho#7784,That’s going to be hard to find
BlazeThief#4311,f
BlazeThief#4311,whats a good price for a keyboard
BlazeThief#4311,that i know it isnt garbage
Aho#7784,Around a 100 dollars but the one I have is 50 and is amazing
BlazeThief#4311,is that just because its smaller?
Aho#7784,Not only that but it uses optic mechanical switches which is better for response time and duration
BlazeThief#4311,might just get another logitech one
BlazeThief#4311,oh dang
Aho#7784,You can
Aho#7784,And it’s really cheap
BlazeThief#4311,i wonder how osu will feel with the change from my keyboard to mechanical
Aho#7784,Weird at first but you’ll get used it it
Aho#7784,That’s probably the main reason why I bought it
BlazeThief#4311,lets go bois
Aho#7784,Bro that’s like the best keyboard out there
BlazeThief#4311,exactly
Aho#7784,So you want any mechanical keyboard? Under 100
Aho#7784,That’s also bigger than a 60% right?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,some of the logitech ones looked decent
Aho#7784,Honestly go for it then
Aho#7784,Logitech has trusted keyboard
Aho#7784,"""But what kind of switches do you like? Red"
BlazeThief#4311,i dont know the difference
BlazeThief#4311,ive only used this keyboard
Aho#7784,"""Reds are linear"
BlazeThief#4311,why would you want blue if its clunky?
Aho#7784,Exactly
Aho#7784,Reds has a faster activation time
Aho#7784,Browns are blues but not clunky
BlazeThief#4311,what does brown do
BlazeThief#4311,which is the softest?
Aho#7784,But if you like to feel something as your clicking down then go for browns because reds just bottoms out
Aho#7784,Reds are the softest
Aho#7784,And easiest to press
Aho#7784,If you want red switches then look for a mechanical keyboard with red switches
BlazeThief#4311,will they cost more though
Aho#7784,Not really
BlazeThief#4311,this one says you can customize it
BlazeThief#4311,but what switches would it originally come with
BlazeThief#4311,oh wait you can choose
BlazeThief#4311,its a pre order though
Aho#7784,Looks like blues
Aho#7784,Get it
Aho#7784,It looks good
Aho#7784,But you can order reds
Aho#7784,So I approve of this keyboard it looks good
BlazeThief#4311,is red the master race
BlazeThief#4311,no volume slider so its an f
BlazeThief#4311,but i can get used to not using it
Aho#7784,Yeah it’s nice to have but not necessary
Aho#7784,Wait the keyboard doesn’t have a volume wheel
Aho#7784,"""If you preorder with reds"
Aho#7784,But I suggest getting a 60% or 65% because they save so much room and honestly looks way nicer than a full keyboard
BlazeThief#4311,did it say when it was coming out?
BlazeThief#4311,i didnt see
Aho#7784,no
Aho#7784,but if you want a good 60% look at the anne pro 2
BlazeThief#4311,honestly i like how bigger keyboards are
Aho#7784,ok
BlazeThief#4311,my boney fingers need more room
Aho#7784,oh no they provides as much room for the keycaps as regulars one just without all the unnecessary keys
Aho#7784,but if you like those keys then get a full size one
BlazeThief#4311,alright
BlazeThief#4311,ill look at some more tomorrow probably but im going to head to sleep goodnight
Aho#7784,goodnight
Aho#7784,this is honestly really good for it's price
Aho#7784,@BlazeThief
J-Klar#4158,No numpad lol
BlazeThief#4311,Gotta get the thick numpad

Suzuya#4203,Bruh there’s speculated hero bans in OW
Suzuya#4203,That’s dumb as hell there’s like 3 hero’s and they really gonna be banning half of them on one game
J-Klar#4158,Well it will probably be more like sieges bans than lols
J-Klar#4158,Like per team rather than per players
Lucаs#7263,i think OW bans would be great
Suzuya#4203,permaban sombra tbh
Lucаs#7263,honestly
Lucаs#7263,its literally just personalized balancing
Lucаs#7263,if someones strong in bronze and not in GM ban in bronze and not in GM no harm done
Lucаs#7263,exept if there are 2 banned for tank and sup that would only leave 4 to choose from which means 2 people would have to share a pool of only 4 ppl
Lucаs#7263,thats kinda bad
Suzuya#4203,thats what i mean tho the champ pool aint big enough tbh
Suzuya#4203,siege the characters play similarly enough but the gameplay in OW is way too different character to character
karthiccc#0069,@J-Klar want me to ask dube for your math mark?
Suzuya#4203,@karthiccc what did you get for the Rtot in the end?
karthiccc#0069,23
Suzuya#4203,pog
Suzuya#4203,i think that comes out to 0.3 percent error
Suzuya#4203,because it makes Itot 0.239 and the actual one for us is 0.24
J-Klar#4158,@karthiccc Ye
BlazeThief#4311,Overwatch bans will be good
BlazeThief#4311,it will most likely be like 2 per team

karthiccc#0069,then punch in the numbers and isolate for delta time
karthiccc#0069,whats so hard?
J-Klar#4158,"""Yeah no I get all of that"

Aho#7784,They made all the Jungle pool for next patch just do more damage against monster
Aho#7784,nothing else basically
Aho#7784,For Lux they made her Root cooldown go down and damage goes up
Aho#7784,Caitlyn attack speed is increasing 10% at lvl 1

Suzuya#4203,sett got shoehorned in which i aint complaining but hes meant to be a top laner
Aho#7784,isn't there one coming in the summer

karthiccc#0069,So i can be me
karthiccc#0069,But in game
Aho#7784,Oh my
Suzuya#4203,bruh hes funny but hes pretty garbo rn
karthiccc#0069,Really?
Suzuya#4203,sadly
Aho#7784,Don't say I've watch a streamer do good on him
Suzuya#4203,hes someone thats really good in pros so they keep him in the dimps
karthiccc#0069,How tho? He's ap
Suzuya#4203,dumps
karthiccc#0069,Doesnt he scale big time?
Suzuya#4203,you can do good on him but hes pretty mechanically hard to learn
Suzuya#4203,if you spend the time it could be fun tho
karthiccc#0069,"""Ey man"
Suzuya#4203,not many good matchups
karthiccc#0069,Yeesh
Suzuya#4203,"""you can do good on him im just saying especially because ur still tryna refine ur jungle"
karthiccc#0069,Fair enough
karthiccc#0069,Ill stick to them braindead people then
Suzuya#4203,legit olaf
Suzuya#4203,ww
Suzuya#4203,yi
karthiccc#0069,Jax
Aho#7784,NuNu
karthiccc#0069,^
karthiccc#0069,But i cant play nunu
Suzuya#4203,jax aint quite as braindead as yi but still pretty close
karthiccc#0069,He better imo
Suzuya#4203,you should give him another chance in case you need to tank at anytime
Aho#7784,Garen next patch
Suzuya#4203,he is
karthiccc#0069,Eyyy true
karthiccc#0069,Garen jg
karthiccc#0069,My new main
Suzuya#4203,get rammus for another saucy tank
karthiccc#0069,He expensive tho
Suzuya#4203,is he?
karthiccc#0069,48
Suzuya#4203,i thought he was 450
Aho#7784,Ramus is also getting a buff
karthiccc#0069,Bruh really?
Suzuya#4203,yuh but its only a bit of attack speed
karthiccc#0069,450 damn
karthiccc#0069,Might have to buy the boy
Suzuya#4203,idk if he is
Suzuya#4203,i thought he was but i could be wrong
karthiccc#0069,1350
karthiccc#0069,But still cheap
Suzuya#4203,yuh thats cheap asl
Suzuya#4203,you can probably pick up trundle for another braindead jg
karthiccc#0069,True
Suzuya#4203,hes 48 i think but hes doing saucy rn
karthiccc#0069,He got pretty nice slow
Suzuya#4203,and mundo
karthiccc#0069,I got mundo
Suzuya#4203,very early game is absolute trash but once he gets going its ridiculous
karthiccc#0069,Tru
Suzuya#4203,legit tanking entire teams for like 15 seconds
karthiccc#0069,I mean even top he broken af
Suzuya#4203,you can also get j4
Suzuya#4203,solid engage heavy champ
karthiccc#0069,I wanted to get him but he 4800
Suzuya#4203,just do it pussy
karthiccc#0069,Im broke in blue essence
Suzuya#4203,xin is really good especially if you dont wanna think
karthiccc#0069,But i do wanna think
karthiccc#0069,Its either gonna be rammus or j4
Suzuya#4203,loll but you need to not think for a bit so you can begin to balance ganking farming and getting objs
Suzuya#4203,its really hard to do
karthiccc#0069,Big true
Suzuya#4203,i was showing jordan and derrick this
karthiccc#0069,Showing what?
Suzuya#4203,me in 2018
Suzuya#4203,its hard to learn so you need braindead champs to get it vibing
Suzuya#4203,then you can pick up taliyah and nidalee
karthiccc#0069,Bruh not nidalee
Suzuya#4203,lol
karthiccc#0069,She hard af
karthiccc#0069,Wayyyy too many abilities
Suzuya#4203,taliyah is hard too but she scales super well
Suzuya#4203,it really aint that bad if you try her out
karthiccc#0069,"""I mean"
karthiccc#0069,But even then
Suzuya#4203,**if
karthiccc#0069,Big IF
karthiccc#0069,Im mostly gonna be around the decent to not that bad area
Suzuya#4203,eve is really cheap too and shes a saucy assassin that scales pretty well
karthiccc#0069,I have her
karthiccc#0069,But i do shit with her
Suzuya#4203,hard to do at first
Suzuya#4203,but shes pretty vibing
Suzuya#4203,"""you should get karthus just for the names being similar"
Suzuya#4203,great at chasing
karthiccc#0069,He a slow boy aint he?
Suzuya#4203,you can get rylais
karthiccc#0069,I guess
Suzuya#4203,but you dont rush it or anything
Suzuya#4203,his w is a giant lane wide wall that slows the enemy
karthiccc#0069,His ult is super helpful thats foe sure
Suzuya#4203,stopwatch tho
Suzuya#4203,always upsetting
karthiccc#0069,But how many people really build it?
Suzuya#4203,a good amount
Suzuya#4203,especially when you get to higher levels in comp
karthiccc#0069,But why would a mid or top need stopwatch
Suzuya#4203,just stopwatch not zhonyas
karthiccc#0069,You think imma be getting to higher levels?
karthiccc#0069,Bronze 4 baby
Suzuya#4203,its a one time thing but they'll still get it because its really useful
Suzuya#4203,vi is a decent mix between braindead and not
karthiccc#0069,But she falls off doesnt she?
Suzuya#4203,one skillshot to engage but then its point and clicks and basic attacks
Suzuya#4203,she aint as good in teamfights
karthiccc#0069,Also i tried her in pbe and didnt like her
Suzuya#4203,yeah
Suzuya#4203,fair nuff
karthiccc#0069,Most definetly gonna be j4 next
karthiccc#0069,Time to int boys
Suzuya#4203,yeah rammus is good but hes dirt cheap so you can get him anytime'
karthiccc#0069,Exactly
Suzuya#4203,if you fucking up ur f and s combo for engage its over on the spot
Suzuya#4203,unless you got ulty then maybe its salvageable
Suzuya#4203,its pretty hard to mess up tho
karthiccc#0069,The kockup right?
Suzuya#4203,unless they flash or dash
Suzuya#4203,yuh
Suzuya#4203,its the e and the q
karthiccc#0069,Yee
karthiccc#0069,Isnt that all his kit really is?
karthiccc#0069,Like thats the main thing
Suzuya#4203,"""e"
Suzuya#4203,w if low
Suzuya#4203,spam basic attacks
karthiccc#0069,W is just a shield right
Suzuya#4203,yuh i think its a minor slow too
karthiccc#0069,Aoe slow?
Suzuya#4203,i believe
karthiccc#0069,Not bad
karthiccc#0069,Ult is pretty cool tho
karthiccc#0069,Is he good early game?
Suzuya#4203,yeah but pretty much every dash can get out of it
Suzuya#4203,hes not bad
karthiccc#0069,Thats all i need
Suzuya#4203,the thing is people can get out of ur ult really easily if they have movement
karthiccc#0069,So like ezreal e?
Suzuya#4203,so you'll ult and theyll leave and ur left waiting for the recast to drop the wall
Suzuya#4203,yeah as long as ez has it he could get out super easily
karthiccc#0069,Wait you can't leave?
Suzuya#4203,talon can jump over it
karthiccc#0069,So like camille ult?
karthiccc#0069,Bruh
Suzuya#4203,no you can
karthiccc#0069,Oh ok
Suzuya#4203,but you'd have to either e+q out
karthiccc#0069,Kinda scuffed
Suzuya#4203,or recast and wait a sec for it to go away
karthiccc#0069,Kinda dumb ngl
Suzuya#4203,yeah thats why hes in B tier rn i think
karthiccc#0069,Nah he A i checked
Suzuya#4203,used to be better but every good champ is so hypermobile for the most part
karthiccc#0069,Yeah makes sense
Suzuya#4203,ur legit bad
karthiccc#0069,Welp mist've looked st someone else then
karthiccc#0069,Im blind
karthiccc#0069,I have an excuse
Suzuya#4203,eve is A tier
Suzuya#4203,shes my favorite counter to Katarina and Sett
karthiccc#0069,I mean assasins gonna be assasins
karthiccc#0069,Ez delete
Suzuya#4203,the thing is most people dont build magic resist nearly as much as armor so she gets to kill them ez asl
karthiccc#0069,She good but until lvl 6
karthiccc#0069,The grind to lvl 6 is hard for me
karthiccc#0069,Takes me forever
Suzuya#4203,you can still gank its just like 20x easier to do it once she is 6
karthiccc#0069,Yeah but your super squishy
Suzuya#4203,bruh literally just powerfarm jg and gank maybe once or twice to leech xp from the laners
karthiccc#0069,"""Dont forget"
karthiccc#0069,Easier said than done
Suzuya#4203,ik
Suzuya#4203,thats why im giving u those tips
Suzuya#4203,but just the tip
BlazeThief#4311,kinda shat tips
BlazeThief#4311,just win 500 iq
Suzuya#4203,tf you mean
karthiccc#0069,Im def gonna die to ganking
Suzuya#4203,poggers
karthiccc#0069,That just how i roll
karthiccc#0069,Die while ganking
BlazeThief#4311,thats me but in lane
Suzuya#4203,i mean as eve you are probably gonna be almost full health ganking so you shouldnt die as long as you dont go in without ur laners
BlazeThief#4311,die while trying to be epic
karthiccc#0069,I keep overestimating her ult range
karthiccc#0069,So i always fuck that up
Suzuya#4203,dont have quickcast on you fuck
BlazeThief#4311,just hover over it if you arent sure
karthiccc#0069,Quick cast is so kuch faster tho
karthiccc#0069,Its nice
BlazeThief#4311,quick cast best cast
karthiccc#0069,Amen
Suzuya#4203,legit use this
Suzuya#4203,this is what i use
Suzuya#4203,its quickcast if you just tap it but if you hold it it shows the indicators
karthiccc#0069,"""Yeah"
karthiccc#0069,But normal quick cast so much easier imo
karthiccc#0069,Minus not knowing range
Suzuya#4203,but if ur botching a bunch of abilities especially ultimates then it aint really easier
karthiccc#0069,Good point
karthiccc#0069,But i never learn
Suzuya#4203,if you know the champ super well then quickcast is vibing
Suzuya#4203,but when ur learning a new champ every week it really shouldnt be on rn
karthiccc#0069,I guess i gotta turn that ting back on
Suzuya#4203,@karthiccc @J-Klar nunu smite plus Q total damage to monsters at all levels if you max Q first
karthiccc#0069,Bruh
karthiccc#0069,Now thats a lot of damage
Suzuya#4203,yeah thats why its impossible to steal from nunu unless you have the best timing in the world
karthiccc#0069,Teah but imma still find a way to fuck up the q
karthiccc#0069,Thats just how I roll
Suzuya#4203,just q then immediately smite in the middle of the q
Suzuya#4203,ez
karthiccc#0069,Easier said than done
karthiccc#0069,For me
karthiccc#0069,Im god at fucking shit up

J-Klar#4158,Just Kidding
Aho#7784,are you?
karthiccc#0069,What happened?
karthiccc#0069,Everyone ganging up on lucas again?
Aho#7784,Lucas got mad when jake stole his kills
J-Klar#4158,not really stealing. I had a good game after we play sup and adc and he left discord half way through
karthiccc#0069,Bruh
Lucаs#7263,"""jake literally said """"im making it so you never play sup again"""" he was """"showing me how I play sup"""" by stealing kills and farm and putting me behind"""
karthiccc#0069,"""I mean"
karthiccc#0069,Literally all of us do that when we play supp
Suzuya#4203,"""its not that you do it lucas"
Lucаs#7263,ok so i dont play sup anymore?
Lucаs#7263,then why do you have to make my bot lane games literally terrible
Aho#7784,not all of us do that
Aho#7784,we do that when we are ahead
Aho#7784,"""and Lucas you are playing swain as a bot lane"
Lucаs#7263,"""yes but jake delayed my level 6 which puts me even further behind for the sole purpose of """"giving me a taste of my own medicine"""""""
Aho#7784,Delay how?
Lucаs#7263,by taking farm and stealing kills
Suzuya#4203,him getting cs doesnt take away xp
Aho#7784,There's shared EXP
Suzuya#4203,and kills give nothing
Lucаs#7263,and making me less powerfull so i die more
Lucаs#7263,and am not htere to get farm
Aho#7784,He has relic shield
Aho#7784,which shares CS
Lucаs#7263,not if im dead
Lucаs#7263,?
Suzuya#4203,then dont int lol
Lucаs#7263,kinda hard when jake is making me useless and I just get farmed and he doesnt help
Lucаs#7263,jake literally hit lvl 6 before me
J-Klar#4158,sounds like a you problem
J-Klar#4158,literally one kill was taken from you and then I started roaming
Lucаs#7263,"""again you literally said something along the lines of """"you'll never want to sup again"""""""
Lucаs#7263,or
Lucаs#7263,Ill make it so you never sup again
Aho#7784,Lol
J-Klar#4158,I mean you made me never want to adc again
BlazeThief#4311,damn
Lucаs#7263,"""not intentionally though thats the difference"
Lucаs#7263,and you continued to ruin my other positions
Lucаs#7263,thats the diffrence here
Lucаs#7263,and then you continue to provoke me when I leave the channel
J-Klar#4158,yah
J-Klar#4158,?
J-Klar#4158,because you legit left discord and started inting
Lucаs#7263,I didn't start inting i literally performed better
J-Klar#4158,I had more dmg than you
Lucаs#7263,ok? its hard to fully recover from a terrible early game. Im saying that I left discord and didn't start inting
Lucаs#7263,not that I had more dmg
Lucаs#7263,I never said that because its not true
karthiccc#0069,Ok how about this
karthiccc#0069,I adc

Pizzanat#6176,that not elite
BlazeThief#4311,i mean teams playing

Pizzanat#6176,o well
BlazeThief#4311,danngg
BlazeThief#4311,i just know ssg won i think

BlazeThief#4311,oo
BlazeThief#4311,is nip ninjas in pajamas
BlazeThief#4311,?
Pizzanat#6176,ya and oops tsm vs nip already happened
Pizzanat#6176,so it ssg vs nip
Pizzanat#6176,and ssg starts with one map won already cuz they in top bracket
BlazeThief#4311,2 op
J-Klar#4158,They technically don't start with a map win. The decider map is theirs meaning if it goes 2-2 SSG will win
J-Klar#4158,"""And yeah Merak the ash elite does have two variants"
BlazeThief#4311,so if they tie 2 to 2 they just win?
J-Klar#4158,Yup
Pizzanat#6176,nice
BlazeThief#4311,what happens if they just go 2
BlazeThief#4311,and the other team is 0
J-Klar#4158,They win
BlazeThief#4311,so once they get 2 they just win
BlazeThief#4311,ebic gamer style
Pizzanat#6176,as in they have a map advantage?
J-Klar#4158,yah

BlazeThief#4311,its driving while intoxicated
BlazeThief#4311,dui is under influence isnt it
BlazeThief#4311,so that probably means like high and stuff like that
Lucаs#7263,i mean im pretty sure weed and other drugs may count as intoxication maybe its just a merican thing
J-Klar#4158,Under the influence counts for narcotics or alcohol
BlazeThief#4311,apparently  you get dwi if you BAC is .08 or higher
BlazeThief#4311,and dui if its less
BlazeThief#4311,but its different between us states

Lucаs#7263,Not that it would matter to u but yeah it doesn’t run well on mine
J-Klar#4158,"""I mean poor optimisation would still effect me. It would be the kinda game I should be able to run 240"
Lucаs#7263,What’s ur monitors hz tho
J-Klar#4158,144
J-Klar#4158,I kinda want to get a 240 though

J-Klar#4158,Cuz when games run at 60 fps it would be kinda sexy
Lucаs#7263,I don’t even know what it does
J-Klar#4158,It changes the refresh rate of the monitor to your current fps to eliminate screen tearing
J-Klar#4158,and you won't have that issue of suttering after fps drops
Lucаs#7263,Ah
J-Klar#4158,Dude you can get 240hz for so cheap

maximumeffort1#3058,The druid gives you the crimson powder
maximumeffort1#3058,If shes in a graveyard
BlazeThief#4311,looking at the wiki it might be seeds instead of powder
BlazeThief#4311,and it has to be in hardmode
maximumeffort1#3058,You want something called vicious powder for spreading crimson
maximumeffort1#3058,Or vile powder for the corruption

J-Klar#4158,Yall really dont like the game
J-Klar#4158,feels bad man
BlazeThief#4311,maybe its not that they really dont like it but more like they just dont want to only play it all day everyday
BlazeThief#4311,gotta spice it up
J-Klar#4158,I mean Lucas flat out said he didn't like it
J-Klar#4158,So
Aho#7784,but Merak is right
J-Klar#4158,I mean I gues
J-Klar#4158,Personally I pretty much play it all day cuz when Im not playing Im watching content related to it lol
J-Klar#4158,addiction at its finest
Aho#7784,I mean I used to be like that..... until I played it too much
J-Klar#4158,I mean I started playing quite a bit after you and already have more games played
J-Klar#4158,I think it's just that I really like the challenge
J-Klar#4158,theres just so much to learn
J-Klar#4158,and perfect
J-Klar#4158,that it could never be boring
Aho#7784,it's more like it's not boring and more of it's like not being as enjoyable as when I first started
J-Klar#4158,Why is it less fun tho
J-Klar#4158,I think for me the reverse applies
J-Klar#4158,I find it more fun now than I did when I started
BlazeThief#4311,It's like you with terraria you dont like it as much as I do
BlazeThief#4311,Different peeps have different interests and opinions on stuff
BlazeThief#4311,It's like watching a movie or show and thinking it was amazing but someone else doesn't like it very much
karthiccc#0069,"""a games a game"

Aho#7784,back
Aho#7784,oh
J-Klar#4158,already want to switch of adc btw
J-Klar#4158,I think I have mental issues
J-Klar#4158,severe issues of the greener grass
BlazeThief#4311,That is adc my brother
J-Klar#4158,no not because of the role
J-Klar#4158,in the past month i've gone from top to mid to adc to sup to adc and now here
J-Klar#4158,like blevimator prime
BlazeThief#4311,Blevimator Prime?
J-Klar#4158,its where blev isn't enough
BlazeThief#4311,The Second Form of The Blevimator
J-Klar#4158,Like each role has their pros well except top and jungle
J-Klar#4158,those are icky
BlazeThief#4311,what are the pros to mid bot and supp
J-Klar#4158,Supp: I think Im really good at it (controlling vision and at the champs in general) and you can impact the entire map and help get people fed which is always cool
J-Klar#4158,Bot: Some of the champions can be really fun and if you have a sup you're qd swith it can also be fun but not as much as sup
J-Klar#4158,Mid: The champs are reallllly fun it has the most influence and you can solo q
J-Klar#4158,Also the idea of 1 v 1 is more appealing
J-Klar#4158,because you're styling on fools
Aho#7784,that's why I play mid
J-Klar#4158,So idk what to do
J-Klar#4158,and its getting annoying switching because its stopping me from improving
J-Klar#4158,Merak I needed your guidance
J-Klar#4158,and you left me
J-Klar#4158,Just like how you always leave me
J-Klar#4158,:(
J-Klar#4158,What did I do to deserve it
BlazeThief#4311,Bruv I took melatonin and am heading to sleep
J-Klar#4158,never sleep
J-Klar#4158,thats how they get you
BlazeThief#4311,My take and guidance is every role in league is crap
BlazeThief#4311,Mid lane you win a 1v1 but can just get ganked
J-Klar#4158,yeah but if u have good vision you prevent that
J-Klar#4158,or at least limit it
BlazeThief#4311,Top your too isolated and can also get camped and since you are so far away from drag you can lose jungle pressure from your jungler
BlazeThief#4311,bot is yuck
BlazeThief#4311,lose one fight and your done most of the time
BlazeThief#4311,everyone is also too reliant on jungler
J-Klar#4158,Also a cs slave
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
J-Klar#4158,and support you cant carry
BlazeThief#4311,just play pyke lol
J-Klar#4158,they have to be low tho and god forbid your teammates do dmg
J-Klar#4158,Holy crap theres a level 504 in my game
J-Klar#4158,What a grinder
Lucаs#7263,Wtf jake
Lucаs#7263,Did you only sleep for like 5 hours?

Aho#7784,Just like Diana rework
J-Klar#4158,ye
Lucаs#7263,They might give him passive stacks for Q hits that would make him so much better
Lucаs#7263,Q then approach velocity then auto auto q they stunned
Aho#7784,They’re switching the ultra and W around
Lucаs#7263,Honestly I’m sad about no more Uber eats but it looks like it’s be chill
Aho#7784,They will be Uber eats just not big range
Aho#7784,And damage on impact
Lucаs#7263,Cool that his new w could be used for engage or u could just save it for get out of gank
Aho#7784,^^^
Lucаs#7263,And you’ll always have it which is nice
Aho#7784,What was his W?
Lucаs#7263,Not 3 minute base CD
Lucаs#7263,W was eat
Lucаs#7263,So now his out is way teammate or enemy
Aho#7784,So he will be eating at lvl 6
Lucаs#7263,Ye
Aho#7784,And probably maybe start munching on them while in there
Aho#7784,Hopefully it won’t be as OP as Diana rework

BlazeThief#4311,so what happens if you stick your willy in the microwave
Lucаs#7263,if u remember ur past experience im down its just like living again. but if u just forget everything its essentially the same as dying
maximumeffort1#3058,Are you sure?
J-Klar#4158,nope
maximumeffort1#3058,Are you arguing about what happens after death
BlazeThief#4311,Lucas you are the avatar

J-Klar#4158,tf
maximumeffort1#3058,Oof
J-Klar#4158,like I just want to feel the exact same experience i feel now in another body
Lucаs#7263,Because how are you supposed to be happy with the new life you get if you don’t have this one to contrast it to
J-Klar#4158,with a different life
BlazeThief#4311,but what if its the same and you never knew
J-Klar#4158,because from my pov it doesn't matter
J-Klar#4158,im literally miserable
BlazeThief#4311,blev
Lucаs#7263,Reincarnation without memory is just dying
BlazeThief#4311,you need to go to a therapist or something
BlazeThief#4311,if you are actually depressed
J-Klar#4158,eh not really
J-Klar#4158,how am I supposed to know if im depressed
Lucаs#7263,You are
J-Klar#4158,ok arent most people
BlazeThief#4311,from the sounds of it you legit hate existing and spend every day in agony
BlazeThief#4311,and sadness
BlazeThief#4311,and loneliness
J-Klar#4158,no I spend every day in the most nuetral state
J-Klar#4158,with tones of sadness
BlazeThief#4311,blev
J-Klar#4158,I just want to change who I am but u know how hard that is?
BlazeThief#4311,what do you want to change into
J-Klar#4158,I spend like a lot of time thinking about being somebody different but whenever I try to change myself I just give up
BlazeThief#4311,Find the first step
Lucаs#7263,I mean it depends what u wanna change tho
J-Klar#4158,The issue is most of it is impossible
J-Klar#4158,"""I want to change my body"
J-Klar#4158,I want to actually like myself
J-Klar#4158,because I dont have anything to like
BlazeThief#4311,how do you want to change your body?
J-Klar#4158,or even anything interesting about myself. It always feels that everybody else has a thing and Im just bland
J-Klar#4158,not worth taking an interest in
BlazeThief#4311,and if you want to be nicer surround yourself with nicer stuff
J-Klar#4158,Thats not the issue
Lucаs#7263,Just pick one small thing every day and do it to start
BlazeThief#4311,Thats legit everyone my guy
BlazeThief#4311,you have things people would like
J-Klar#4158,Name 1 thing about me thats good my mans
BlazeThief#4311,I cant think of things people would like about me
Aho#7784,So what was the 291 messages I missed?
J-Klar#4158,I think you're a nice person and I like how you dont swear
J-Klar#4158,I could name 1 thing I like about all of u
J-Klar#4158,and much more
J-Klar#4158,but I actually cant think of anything I like about myself
Aho#7784,I don't see why anyone would like me
BlazeThief#4311,That seems to be the case with most people
BlazeThief#4311,you aint alone
Aho#7784,I can think of a thing about you Jake
J-Klar#4158,See and I know that which then makes me guilty of feeling this way and feeling isolated when i do know that everyone feels this way
J-Klar#4158,what would that be jordan
BlazeThief#4311,Why does it make you feel guilty though?
J-Klar#4158,Because I feel that I deserve more when there are people who are much worse off than me
J-Klar#4158,I shouldn't feel so sad when i have so much
BlazeThief#4311,Nah thats what I think sometimes aswell and its scuffed
BlazeThief#4311,I know exactly what you mean
BlazeThief#4311,and it just aint true we just gotta convince ourselfs it like that
J-Klar#4158,it is true though
BlazeThief#4311,like there are people that are worse off in other traits
BlazeThief#4311,but that doesnt make ours any less
J-Klar#4158,And I dont deserve help because I cant even help myself
BlazeThief#4311,that dont make sense lad
BlazeThief#4311,if you cant fix the issue yourself
BlazeThief#4311,you look for help from others
BlazeThief#4311,that just how it be
J-Klar#4158,nobody knows how to help though
J-Klar#4158,because I dont even know whats wrong
J-Klar#4158,I just always feel that Im missing some 'thing' that will change my life foreever and make me happ
BlazeThief#4311,well we are still pretty young
Lucаs#7263,No
BlazeThief#4311,you aint really missing anything atm
BlazeThief#4311,its just at this point what people be doing is different
J-Klar#4158,im not doing anything tho
J-Klar#4158,i just feel like a plastic bag in the wind
BlazeThief#4311,same with most people
J-Klar#4158,how are they ok with that
BlazeThief#4311,they arent
J-Klar#4158,its agonizing being so disconnected from my body
BlazeThief#4311,how you disconnected?
J-Klar#4158,time is passing and Im just not here
J-Klar#4158,Literally nothing is happening
Lucаs#7263,U gotta make it happen
BlazeThief#4311,exactly
BlazeThief#4311,if you do nothing
BlazeThief#4311,nothing will happen
BlazeThief#4311,if you dont want to be watching movies and stuff do something different
J-Klar#4158,I mean obviously but Im too lazy to do anything which then reminds me that I just dont like who I am
BlazeThief#4311,if you dont like staying in the house all day go outside
BlazeThief#4311,blev
BlazeThief#4311,you just gotta take the leap
J-Klar#4158,You know I actually did
BlazeThief#4311,just game out the door
BlazeThief#4311,and go on a walk or something
BlazeThief#4311,rather than be in the house
J-Klar#4158,During grade 10 I lost 20 pounds and then I just stopped and put it back on
J-Klar#4158,no clue why
BlazeThief#4311,Just do it again
BlazeThief#4311,we go agane

J-Klar#4158,well yeah cuz I got up at 5pm yesterday
J-Klar#4158,and the day before
Lucаs#7263,hella wack
J-Klar#4158,not really
J-Klar#4158,what difference does it make
J-Klar#4158,im up for a normal amount of time
Lucаs#7263,youre becoming nocturnal?
Lucаs#7263,which humans are not
J-Klar#4158,the point is not like I have anyone to interact with lmao
J-Klar#4158,or anything to do
J-Klar#4158,so why care
Lucаs#7263,so why not just do what u do at normal time
J-Klar#4158,well I do
J-Klar#4158,but sometimes id like stay up the night cuz gaming and then I just can't be asked to reset sleep schedule
Lucаs#7263,yeah just stay up 24hrs and sleep the next night
J-Klar#4158,no shit
J-Klar#4158,but thats tiring as hell

J-Klar#4158,eh what
Lucаs#7263,"""I personally dont think thats a good source of confidence"
J-Klar#4158,well how else would u get it. i just want to be able to think that others would like me
J-Klar#4158,i honestly just want to ask her out but like i said no self confidence
Lucаs#7263,just learn to like you for who you are
Lucаs#7263,theres literally nothing not to like
J-Klar#4158,didn't think of that one
Lucаs#7263,if you think about it noone really cares how you look
Lucаs#7263,just your contents
J-Klar#4158,if only that were true. we all know that its not really realistic. in relationships people don't like each other solely for personality there is still physical attraction
Lucаs#7263,"""yeah but its pretty miniscule"
J-Klar#4158,"""i doubt that. im not saying that I think I have any major personality flaws or whatever and id like to think im likeable most of the time"

Lucаs#7263,thats unique and interesting
Lucаs#7263,quite literally no one is the same combonation of DNA as you you are quite wrong
J-Klar#4158,i just personally don't see why anybody would choose to be with me over someone else. obv im not different but I don't have anything about me that someone could find appealing is what I mean.
Lucаs#7263,dont really konw what to say to that mate u gotta work that out
J-Klar#4158,yeppers. Idk one day Ill have the balls to ask someone out and then I'll know. I guess Im just scared that if she says no itll be kinda confirming my theory. i would say im kinda scared that I will die alone. u know? like there are people out there that simply just never find someone. that has to be super painful
Lucаs#7263,"""idk but for me i just kinda feel like i dont mind being alone at all"
J-Klar#4158,"""I used to think that way too that because I was introverted I was fine just having boys"
Lucаs#7263,how u feel alone tho when u literally got like 5-7 dudes to talk to almost 24/7
J-Klar#4158,its not really the same
J-Klar#4158,theres quite the difference
J-Klar#4158,also I dont really mean now I just mean in the future

BlazeThief#4311,Valorant seems fun when I watch sykkuno play it
J-Klar#4158,its like league
J-Klar#4158,looks fun
BlazeThief#4311,but it may not live up to the gamingness
BlazeThief#4311,nah
BlazeThief#4311,you watch yassuo
J-Klar#4158,not really
J-Klar#4158,he got so obnoxious
Aho#7784,Sykunno really do make everything fun tho
BlazeThief#4311,I mean like when you watch someone like him or anyone really play it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth
BlazeThief#4311,I was watching a stream from someone at the card shop I go to and they were being toxic
BlazeThief#4311,like blev
J-Klar#4158,competetive games change people man
BlazeThief#4311,Thats why ffxiv is gaming
J-Klar#4158,they literally just cause mental problems I swear
BlazeThief#4311,chilling
J-Klar#4158,mmos are much better with other poeple tho
BlazeThief#4311,ffxiv and when you get burnt out you play terraria
Aho#7784,"""""""Fucking peek mid I Dare youuuu..... GET OUT OF MY FUCVKING GAME"""" -Jordan 2020 Valorant just last game"""
BlazeThief#4311,oh
J-Klar#4158,yikers
Aho#7784,yeah I was over confident but I WAS KILLING IT
BlazeThief#4311,Lol
BlazeThief#4311,I think if I play league though ill turn my chat off
Aho#7784,yes do that
BlazeThief#4311,would probably make the game 1000x better
Aho#7784,/mute all
Aho#7784,best command in the game
BlazeThief#4311,I think you can just turn a setting on that auto does that stuff at the start of the game
J-Klar#4158,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,not sure though
J-Klar#4158,u can just remove the chat
BlazeThief#4311,gaming
J-Klar#4158,gamers gaming
BlazeThief#4311,gamers gaming on the gaming lifestyle
J-Klar#4158,Actually this gamer isn't
J-Klar#4158,I don't know what to play
J-Klar#4158,any reccomendations
BlazeThief#4311,ffxiv
BlazeThief#4311,terraria
BlazeThief#4311,minecraft
Aho#7784,ffxiV
Aho#7784,minecraft
Aho#7784,Fighterz
J-Klar#4158,A lot of variety there
BlazeThief#4311,mans dont own fighterz
BlazeThief#4311,I have 2k rp
BlazeThief#4311,so i am prepared for ezreal
BlazeThief#4311,or yone
J-Klar#4158,poggers
BlazeThief#4311,most likely ezreal though
Aho#7784,Ez getting a skin?
J-Klar#4158,prestige
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
Aho#7784,I'm ready for Diana Prestige
J-Klar#4158,no one i play is getting one
J-Klar#4158,I wanna get the senna one tho
Aho#7784,ouch
J-Klar#4158,i hope yone is adc
Aho#7784,with a sword?
Aho#7784,first meleee ADC
J-Klar#4158,I mean
J-Klar#4158,yasuo
BlazeThief#4311,if it is then main
J-Klar#4158,I doubt he will be tho
Aho#7784,He's a special exception cause of wind wall
J-Klar#4158,i think its more to do with his e but yeah windwall helps a lot
J-Klar#4158,I mean its not too hard to believe that yone will have an ability similar in strength considering they are brothers
BlazeThief#4311,well isnt yone dead in the lore
BlazeThief#4311,And didnt they say that the next one was a laner that refused to die
BlazeThief#4311,so maybe he just was like nah blev I aint gonna die
BlazeThief#4311,and hes trynd 2.0
J-Klar#4158,im a little confused cuz after lilia it was supposed to be an adc
BlazeThief#4311,ay maybe it will be
J-Klar#4158,me and jordan just slayed with the kat ornn combo
J-Klar#4158,my ult and e synergize so well with his ult
Aho#7784,hell yeeah just keep them in 1 place while I just stack up on dmg
Lucаs#7263,Back to top jake?
J-Klar#4158,no midular so im just waiting for meraks return for the suppening
Aho#7784,he just played top once for me
J-Klar#4158,It's not like you play the game anyway lul
Lucаs#7263,I do when I have time
J-Klar#4158,false
Aho#7784,I play it everyday
Aho#7784,tho not as much as I used to
J-Klar#4158,I can only play like 1 game without other people
Aho#7784,^^^
J-Klar#4158,i find it harder to let tilt get to me with a friend there
Lucаs#7263,Opposite for me
J-Klar#4158,How so
Aho#7784,how can you get tilted with friends there>
J-Klar#4158,I guess it depends on what tilts you
Aho#7784,true
J-Klar#4158,Everyone always complains about others but I honestly tilt myself for the most part
Lucаs#7263,I feel with friends there are higher stakes. If a rando says I’m shit who tf cares if a friend says I’m shit hits a lil different
J-Klar#4158,Yeah I get that
Aho#7784,everyone calls me shit tho.... I mean Karthik does
J-Klar#4158,I guess it's about getting into the mindset that it really doesn't matter if you play poorly
J-Klar#4158,Also that just because you have a bad game you aren't a bad player
Aho#7784,But that means I won't be in the mood next game so I take a long break
karthiccc#0069,"""Jordan.... yes i do"
Aho#7784,yes yes I know
karthiccc#0069,But i stopped playing the game so i dont anymore
karthiccc#0069,I am a changed man
Aho#7784,Mhmm
karthiccc#0069,"""Wait... so if yone turns out to be a mid"
karthiccc#0069,But if he ends up adc then merak perma bot
karthiccc#0069,Where's jordan going?
BlazeThief#4311,Nahh if yone mid and gaming imma play mid

J-Klar#4158,Killing teemo is honestly such a nice feeling
J-Klar#4158,Trampling his furry little head with a massive bull is the best
Aho#7784,I 100% agree with that statement
J-Klar#4158,Are you playing @JORDAN
Aho#7784,sure
J-Klar#4158,Yikes that nami skin

J-Klar#4158,Just destroyed a pantheon in the early levels and he had m7
J-Klar#4158,wasn't even close either
J-Klar#4158,the dmg is insane
Lucаs#7263,ok well imma be real thats a misplay by panth
Lucаs#7263,no way he loses to shen
Lucаs#7263,or a bigbrain play by you
Lucаs#7263,anyone can beat anyone if the player is ass or if ur a god
J-Klar#4158,massive brain play by me
J-Klar#4158,I killed him 3 times then he just started inting
J-Klar#4158,at least I think he was
J-Klar#4158,idk he kept trying to kill me
Lucаs#7263,prob not inting just tilted
J-Klar#4158,despite my 3 level advantage
J-Klar#4158,yeah
J-Klar#4158,he wanted that sweet revenge
J-Klar#4158,i kinda want to get quinn
J-Klar#4158,ranged tops are cringe but shes kinda cool
Lucаs#7263,the best way to get revenge is to look fortp bot and get double kill lol
J-Klar#4158,he had ignite
Lucаs#7263,lmao loser
J-Klar#4158,ignite and still lost
Lucаs#7263,i never take ignite is kinda a waste

Aho#7784,And the beats help you click
Aho#7784,No
Aho#7784,You don’t have to click on the squares

karthiccc#0069,no
karthiccc#0069,tf
J-Klar#4158,wut
maximumeffort1#3058,I think it would be the girls choice
karthiccc#0069,take responsibility for the kid
J-Klar#4158,that is taking responsibility lmao
maximumeffort1#3058,It is
karthiccc#0069,it aint like they out in the streets with her
Aho#7784,They have a rrom for her and everything
karthiccc#0069,exactly
J-Klar#4158,Yes but there are many many couples out there who can never have kids and are in the perfect situation to raise them
karthiccc#0069,she vibin
maximumeffort1#3058,Jake has a point
karthiccc#0069,"""yes jake"

karthiccc#0069,literally your giving away a child
karthiccc#0069,that just is harsh imo
maximumeffort1#3058,Hes not just taking about nick
J-Klar#4158,bruh why r u hating on me im just saying its an option
karthiccc#0069,it is
karthiccc#0069,but
maximumeffort1#3058,Some couples cant take care of a child
karthiccc#0069,i dont like that option
Aho#7784,^^
karthiccc#0069,"""i know that kyle"
maximumeffort1#3058,Would you rather living in a home where you cant be taken care of or put into a home where you can
karthiccc#0069,you got a point
Aho#7784,Yeah but THEY made the decision to keep the baby
karthiccc#0069,"""no we just talking about in general now jordan"
Aho#7784,and THEY do have a proper home to take care of her in
Aho#7784,Oh
maximumeffort1#3058,Obviously yeah because they can take care of her
maximumeffort1#3058,I my mind i feel adoption is better than abortion
karthiccc#0069,yes
karthiccc#0069,agree 100%
karthiccc#0069,"""but to me still"
maximumeffort1#3058,I also feel its the womans choice to make
J-Klar#4158,just because you can doesn't mean you should besides we're not at all saying that our opinions have any effect I was just enquiring as to why maybe they didn't take that option.
karthiccc#0069,yes I agree with taht too
karthiccc#0069,100% womans choice
Aho#7784,is it tho?
karthiccc#0069,i mean yes
karthiccc#0069,"""she delivered the baby"
maximumeffort1#3058,Were not the ones shitting out a babi

karthiccc#0069,nothin more
karthiccc#0069,nothin less
maximumeffort1#3058,Exactly
karthiccc#0069,she going through all the pain
Aho#7784,I think if you're gonna birth a child then you should just keep her
maximumeffort1#3058,And then its the mans choice if he wants to be responsible or an asshole
J-Klar#4158,do u guys think you'll ever find someone who u love and they love u back tho
karthiccc#0069,"""thats what my point is"

J-Klar#4158,bruh plz dont say that
Lucаs#7263,Half Kyle but ok
karthiccc#0069,i mean
maximumeffort1#3058,Old people are always happy
Lucаs#7263,Planning to die at 60
J-Klar#4158,I have to stop telling myself that
karthiccc#0069,60?
karthiccc#0069,you have to stop?
Lucаs#7263,He said at 40 u got a third left
J-Klar#4158,my problems aren't significant
karthiccc#0069,shouldnt we be greatful for this shit rather than be selfish?
karthiccc#0069,"""yeah exactly"
Lucаs#7263,Grateful for wut
karthiccc#0069,tf
J-Klar#4158,dude
maximumeffort1#3058,Being us
karthiccc#0069,grateful that we dont got it hard
karthiccc#0069,like so many other people in the world
J-Klar#4158,how would u know
maximumeffort1#3058,We couldve had shit ass lives
karthiccc#0069,^
J-Klar#4158,just because im not stariving doens't mean i dont suffer lmao
karthiccc#0069,ya but your suffering isnt comparable
maximumeffort1#3058,Bruh what do you suffer from
J-Klar#4158,so it shouldn't matter?
karthiccc#0069,its the whole first world third world type shit
J-Klar#4158,You're literally gatekeeping sadness
karthiccc#0069,name one problem you have jake
maximumeffort1#3058,It matters it just shouldnt be compared to other problems
karthiccc#0069,^
J-Klar#4158,Nobody was comparing other than you
J-Klar#4158,tf
J-Klar#4158,you're literally naming my whole point
karthiccc#0069,"""wait no i meant like"
karthiccc#0069,and you should be happy that you dont have to experience that
Lucаs#7263,If u look at suicide rates for third vs first world countries guess which one is higher
J-Klar#4158,I mean obviously but that doesn't stop you from feeling bad
maximumeffort1#3058,We all have problems
karthiccc#0069,first world
Lucаs#7263,Exactly different problems that aren’t comparable
karthiccc#0069,but you know why thats like that?
maximumeffort1#3058,Exactly
Lucаs#7263,You cannot comparing starving to taking your own life
Lucаs#7263,Different struggles doesn’t mean no struggles
maximumeffort1#3058,Or being homeless to depression
J-Klar#4158,Thats my boy lucas
karthiccc#0069,think about this what is our primal instinct? survival... in first world that is hardly a concern so we concern ourselves with more external factors
karthiccc#0069,you dont see people in africa taking their lives cuz they just think that they need to survive
J-Klar#4158,bruh
maximumeffort1#3058,Or because theyre happy? Tf karthik
karthiccc#0069,or that too i guess
J-Klar#4158,u realize that we barely use primal instincts like that at all
karthiccc#0069,we dont
karthiccc#0069,but people who have it really hard focus on just having  enough to live day to day
maximumeffort1#3058,Nope
maximumeffort1#3058,Thats not how life works
J-Klar#4158,i honestly dont think suicide is cowardly though
karthiccc#0069,depends on situation
J-Klar#4158,its way harder to kill yourself than to live
maximumeffort1#3058,Its an easy way out
J-Klar#4158,its not easy at all
J-Klar#4158,shit is hard af to do
karthiccc#0069,"""if you are in immense pain"
karthiccc#0069,"""but if you hit like a financial low and are taking your life because of that"
Lucаs#7263,Well it’s not just “I have to muney I die”
maximumeffort1#3058,^
Lucаs#7263,There’s a bunch of other shit that comes along with it probably
J-Klar#4158,karthik ur kinda cringing me out rn
karthiccc#0069,true
karthiccc#0069,ight then jake
karthiccc#0069,suicide is fine
karthiccc#0069,happy no more cringe?
maximumeffort1#3058,Karthik dont understand being sad
J-Klar#4158,literally never said that tho
Lucаs#7263,"""You might end up on the streets and ur wife dumps u u lose custody of kids u river raped"
J-Klar#4158,I just said that it isn't cowardly
Lucаs#7263,Not because I lose ur job
Lucаs#7263,U
karthiccc#0069,wait so what was the whole point of this conversation again?
karthiccc#0069,what were we trying to prove?
Lucаs#7263,Karthik dumb
maximumeffort1#3058,We did a full u turn
maximumeffort1#3058,Talking bout having kids to death
karthiccc#0069,we went from adoption to suicide
karthiccc#0069,somehow
J-Klar#4158,i was kinda pissed that you were saying that our problems automatically don't matter because other people are in a worse situation
maximumeffort1#3058,Life sucks and theres nothing you can do about it
karthiccc#0069,"""i never said they dont matter"
J-Klar#4158,and u used that to devalue them
maximumeffort1#3058,Im sure he didnt mean to
J-Klar#4158,maybe i was misreading
karthiccc#0069,"""i didnt mean to devalue"
karthiccc#0069,because everyone has problems in one way or another
maximumeffort1#3058,And we all gotta deal with them
karthiccc#0069,exactly
maximumeffort1#3058,But sometimes they take the better of us
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,they really do
maximumeffort1#3058,"""And sometimes"
karthiccc#0069,"""ya when your options run out"
maximumeffort1#3058,Its your life and you have the power to turn it around
J-Klar#4158,not always tho
karthiccc#0069,"""if you hit rock bottom"
karthiccc#0069,only a climb
Lucаs#7263,And sometimes the problem is drinking
karthiccc#0069,^
karthiccc#0069,ill drink to that jew baby
Lucаs#7263,Lol
J-Klar#4158,but sometimes when u hit rock bottom sometimes u just feel trapped and that u can't climb and thats like when u lose all hope
maximumeffort1#3058,Exactly
karthiccc#0069,the walls arent going to be vertical
maximumeffort1#3058,Thats what we were saying
karthiccc#0069,there is always a way to climb out
karthiccc#0069,just gotta be willing
maximumeffort1#3058,No
karthiccc#0069,and have resolve
maximumeffort1#3058,Not always
J-Klar#4158,the issue is that some people don't think that they're worth the effort
BlazeThief#4311,we talking about elo hell or a kid
Lucаs#7263,Both
karthiccc#0069,we talking about life
karthiccc#0069,hell
BlazeThief#4311,all I see is karthik talking about rock bottom and climbing out

karthiccc#0069,i have no stamina
BlazeThief#4311,me and karthik gotta get that work out on
J-Klar#4158,like im fine in big crowds cuz ppl be grouped

karthiccc#0069,jaspers my source on that
BlazeThief#4311,me and you train under jasper
karthiccc#0069,lol
karthiccc#0069,i can't do cardio
karthiccc#0069,shit tires me out too quickly
BlazeThief#4311,just stretch
J-Klar#4158,i just can't be alone when people are kinda not u know
maximumeffort1#3058,Groups i dont mind its when people speak to me
karthiccc#0069,cant stretch without getting warmed up
maximumeffort1#3058,I start to shake
J-Klar#4158,also when i walk by ppl I hold my breath which is kinda strange
BlazeThief#4311,warm up to strech
karthiccc#0069,yes
BlazeThief#4311,oh I do that
BlazeThief#4311,especially in the hall
J-Klar#4158,mhm
karthiccc#0069,hold the breath?
BlazeThief#4311,dont want to breath on peeps
karthiccc#0069,?
J-Klar#4158,its not that
J-Klar#4158,i just do it subconciously
maximumeffort1#3058,They might judge me
J-Klar#4158,i think its cuz i get scared
BlazeThief#4311,I usually just end up taking big breaths in the form of yawns in the hall lol
karthiccc#0069,never noticed
J-Klar#4158,in the mornings when I finally get to my class im legit like deprived of air
maximumeffort1#3058,I think of all they ways people can judge me and it scares the shit outa me
BlazeThief#4311,same
BlazeThief#4311,cant breath when I get to class
J-Klar#4158,poggers
karthiccc#0069,i used to think like that kyle
karthiccc#0069,there will come a time where you just accept it
maximumeffort1#3058,Oh ive tried
J-Klar#4158,16 years still waiting
karthiccc#0069,took me 15
karthiccc#0069,you'll still feel scared
karthiccc#0069,but just wont care as much
maximumeffort1#3058,Ive got the voices of people making fun of me in my head
karthiccc#0069,it'll just feel normal
karthiccc#0069,yeah I know that feeling
J-Klar#4158,i think it comes from the idea that deep down I know that I dont like myself and I dont want to believe that and when others dont like me it kinda proves it true
J-Klar#4158,which is scuffed
karthiccc#0069,"""yeah"
maximumeffort1#3058,The only people i can talk to are my friends and close family
karthiccc#0069,so you believe they dont like you deep down
J-Klar#4158,its not that
J-Klar#4158,I just think that there really aint much about me positivley or negativley
J-Klar#4158,i just kinda exist without purpose
J-Klar#4158,because nobody really cares about me or something
J-Klar#4158,idk hard to descrive
maximumeffort1#3058,I cant not think of myself negativley
maximumeffort1#3058,So i think everyone thinks of me that way
karthiccc#0069,everyone focuses on the negatives of themselves
maximumeffort1#3058,Its not the same karthik
J-Klar#4158,i think thats why im scared of dying alone. i just want to know that someone likes/loves me enough to want to spend their life with me. i just dont value my own life enough to where me liking myself is enough reason to keep living
maximumeffort1#3058,^
maximumeffort1#3058,Sometimes i feel alone and i never know why
J-Klar#4158,YO
J-Klar#4158,I literally live life feeling completely and utterly isolated
J-Klar#4158,for no reason
maximumeffort1#3058,Yep
J-Klar#4158,and it just feels super crushing like im being squished to death and it sounds cringe but sometimes u can kinda feel it in ur heart
maximumeffort1#3058,Its loneliness
maximumeffort1#3058,Even tho ive got friends amd family with me i still feel a crushing loneliness on my shoulders
maximumeffort1#3058,Bruh im so crimge
J-Klar#4158,life is cringe
J-Klar#4158,i just wish I could know that things are going to work out
maximumeffort1#3058,Im sad now
J-Klar#4158,it doesn't really effect me cuz I spend a lot of time thinking about it that i pretty much already know exactly how im feeling
J-Klar#4158,and despite that I have no idea how to fix myself
maximumeffort1#3058,I want to know that someone likes me back
maximumeffort1#3058,That was really cringe im sorry
J-Klar#4158,u apologizing to me lol? cuz im saying the exact same thing
maximumeffort1#3058,Just to everyone
BlazeThief#4311,nah blev I think the same tings
J-Klar#4158,idk i could be wrong but if i wanted to know if it was just me that felt this way id really like to read something like this to let me know im not alone so i think its good to have these kind of conversations
BlazeThief#4311,though sometimes I look in the mirror and im like damn blev you looking kinda cute blev
J-Klar#4158,i could see my face in the mirror and think im looking sexy then i look at my body and reminded as to why i believe ill always be alone
BlazeThief#4311,just when my hair isnt looking like the a dying woolly mammoth
BlazeThief#4311,just become skinny
BlazeThief#4311,i checked
J-Klar#4158,poggers
maximumeffort1#3058,Jake omg
BlazeThief#4311,I weigh like 143 pounds or something
maximumeffort1#3058,Why do you say what i think
J-Klar#4158,because i live my life one depressive episode at a time
BlazeThief#4311,Would you both say you are depressed ?
J-Klar#4158,100%
maximumeffort1#3058,Life is just a depressiong sitcom
J-Klar#4158,i can be happy in the moment but when i reflect on the past 3 years of my life i just feel sad
maximumeffort1#3058,Honestly i dont know
BlazeThief#4311,that just kinda how it be
BlazeThief#4311,you do cringe things when you younger and cringer
J-Klar#4158,everything I do I regret and everything I dont do I hate myself for not doing
BlazeThief#4311,just gotta look at what you did and decide how you can improve on it
maximumeffort1#3058,Can i inprove though?
BlazeThief#4311,why wouldnt you be able to?
J-Klar#4158,no clue how
maximumeffort1#3058,I feel ill forever be stuck where i am now
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat how the fuck do you stay happy all the bloody time?
J-Klar#4158,lets not presume ppl are perfectly fine and happy
J-Klar#4158,its kinda what my parents do and it annoys me
BlazeThief#4311,yeah man might just be putting a act to lighten the mood
karthiccc#0069,Shit true
karthiccc#0069,He really good at it thats for sure
maximumeffort1#3058,Fake smiles
karthiccc#0069,Like god damn
BlazeThief#4311,could be dealing with some tings behind the scenes
karthiccc#0069,Shit
maximumeffort1#3058,Im gunna go cry now ill be back
J-Klar#4158,i really wish mental health wasn't taboo
karthiccc#0069,Group cry sess?
BlazeThief#4311,how is it taboo?
J-Klar#4158,Compared to physical health?
J-Klar#4158,It's pretty taboo
karthiccc#0069,No one likes talking about it
J-Klar#4158,and a lot of people get memed on for saything that they are depressed
BlazeThief#4311,I guess but its getting better as of recent
J-Klar#4158,yeah of course
J-Klar#4158,still has a way to go
BlazeThief#4311,thats why you need an actual diagnosis
BlazeThief#4311,I remember legit saying to you guys I had severe anxiety and cameron legit just said no you dont
BlazeThief#4311,liike bruh
J-Klar#4158,I was going to therapy for social anxiety but covid happened
BlazeThief#4311,didnt you say you take some stuff for it/
J-Klar#4158,yeah still do
BlazeThief#4311,does it help?
J-Klar#4158,not really
BlazeThief#4311,been thinking of it but kinda sketched by it
BlazeThief#4311,dont want it to change my personality or become reliant on it
J-Klar#4158,I think it is working but it helps more with general anxiety
BlazeThief#4311,I feel anxious about quite litterally anything
BlazeThief#4311,even being with family sometimes
BlazeThief#4311,so it may help
Lucаs#7263,Well about mental health awareness it’s also just that men are less likely to talk about how they feel and shot
Lucаs#7263,Shit
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,thats why we got the bois
J-Klar#4158,men dont really get the sympothy that girls do
J-Klar#4158,which sucks
Lucаs#7263,They are also 3-4x mote likely to commit suicide
Lucаs#7263,Probably a product of not being able to freely talk about emotions that much
BlazeThief#4311,men or women?
Lucаs#7263,Men
BlazeThief#4311,oh men
BlazeThief#4311,yeah they just bottle it up alot right
BlazeThief#4311,but thats both
BlazeThief#4311,just depends on the peeps around them

karthiccc#0069,you mean there are new effects to it?

BlazeThief#4311,like in the first one he braces his left arm with his right to even shoot it then the second hes like floating but using 2 arms and in the last he just 1 arm balling on them
BlazeThief#4311,and he loses the voicelines that make he seem unsure
BlazeThief#4311,like the i hope this works and stuff

BlazeThief#4311,which do you like better though jungle or adc?
J-Klar#4158,karthik not to be rude but I don't want to be your sup if you just hate the game
karthiccc#0069,i despise the game as a whole
karthiccc#0069,so i am not overly biased
BlazeThief#4311,lol
karthiccc#0069,jake thats a fair and valid point
BlazeThief#4311,theres definitely better stuff to play
karthiccc#0069,^
karthiccc#0069,fax
J-Klar#4158,eh depends
J-Klar#4158,on the genre
J-Klar#4158,when it comes to competetive games there isn't
karthiccc#0069,"""with friends tho"
BlazeThief#4311,the game is aight its just I dont like having to devote like 30 to 50 minutes

karthiccc#0069,so basically ornn 2.0 and sona 2.0
J-Klar#4158,not really sure but it does seem like that

karthiccc#0069,got hecarim 2.0
karthiccc#0069,and yas 2.0
J-Klar#4158,aha I got it
J-Klar#4158,"""That about covers everything we wanted to talk about today. Sorry we weren’t able to find the new jungler—what a weird experience that was. I'll make sure to keep my wits about me for the roadmap later this year"
BlazeThief#4311,yone looking like kayn v2
BlazeThief#4311,is sensational related to audio?
J-Klar#4158,well the tune in and hear part is more what im talking about
J-Klar#4158,but sensational kinda fits with the theme as hearing is a sensation
karthiccc#0069,could be just a very vibrant coloured champ
karthiccc#0069,something that stands out
karthiccc#0069,"""same thing for """"sensational"""""""
karthiccc#0069,tune in really could be taken in many ways
J-Klar#4158,eh in combination with hear about it seems like a pretty strong hint
karthiccc#0069,but uh what else would they say?
karthiccc#0069,tune in next time listen?
J-Klar#4158,well considering it aint audio read
karthiccc#0069,the whole tone of the article is as if they are talking to you
J-Klar#4158,sounds kinda scuffed tho
karthiccc#0069,I get what your saying
karthiccc#0069,you could be right
J-Klar#4158,i dont think i am
karthiccc#0069,who knows

BlazeThief#4311,okay blev
Lucаs#7263,Two days of what
J-Klar#4158,me and jordan will be
BlazeThief#4311,your mind changes wayyyyy to much
J-Klar#4158,lmao true
Lucаs#7263,Nah I always dislike the game
BlazeThief#4311,legit one day its like league isnt bad its just annoying sometimes
BlazeThief#4311,then the other its I hate it
J-Klar#4158,lul
Lucаs#7263,"""Yeah because league is a game that changes like that"
Aho#7784,What will I be doing
Lucаs#7263,Adc
Lucаs#7263,Karthus not karthik
J-Klar#4158,thats not the game tho
J-Klar#4158,thats the players
Lucаs#7263,It happens in the game and they do nothing to fix it
BlazeThief#4311,Dont hate the player hate the game
BlazeThief#4311,How are they supposed to fix that?
Lucаs#7263,“Oh we gonna increase dodge penalty”
Lucаs#7263,Nope
Lucаs#7263,“We gonna nerd mid”
Lucаs#7263,Nope
Lucаs#7263,They never actually go thru with any controversial changes
BlazeThief#4311,How would dodge penalty fix that?
Aho#7784,they been nurfing ALOT of mid picks
Lucаs#7263,Mid lane tho
BlazeThief#4311,They arent just going to nerf a role into the ground though
Lucаs#7263,"""It wouldn’t be into the ground"
BlazeThief#4311,What about mid lane dont you like?
Aho#7784,"""it's """"too OP"""""""
BlazeThief#4311,Isnt jungle legit like the strongest role
Aho#7784,It is
Lucаs#7263,Not gold wise
Aho#7784,Jg can just Shut down mid if they want
Aho#7784,So nurf the gold so they get less than every other lane?
BlazeThief#4311,Jungles whole point is to gank
Aho#7784,it'll just make mid characters lacking FAR behind item wise
BlazeThief#4311,thats how they make gold is it not?
BlazeThief#4311,get the camps objectives and gank
Aho#7784,oh nvm read it wrong
Lucаs#7263,Midlanders whole point is to be the center of the game
Lucаs#7263,Bank top or bot
Lucаs#7263,Invade
Lucаs#7263,Help secure drags
BlazeThief#4311,Blev
Lucаs#7263,Mid can do anything jungle can but with FAR more gold
BlazeThief#4311,you could say legit the same thing about bot
Lucаs#7263,No
BlazeThief#4311,Invadew
BlazeThief#4311,Secure drags more consistently
Aho#7784,"""Invade"
Aho#7784,Gank mid
Lucаs#7263,Bot can only secure half objs and cannot tank top
Lucаs#7263,Gank
BlazeThief#4311,gank mid with 2 people instead of 1
Lucаs#7263,"""Ok? Mid can impact literally everything"
BlazeThief#4311,How do you suppose they fix that though
BlazeThief#4311,thats just the lanes position
BlazeThief#4311,like
BlazeThief#4311,you cant really do anything about mid being in the middle of drag and hearld
Aho#7784,Mid is the CENTRE point for a reason
Lucаs#7263,Make them have less gold to even out their positioning advantage
J-Klar#4158,There isn't anything wrong with a lane having more impact than another
J-Klar#4158,It's by design
Lucаs#7263,That’s EXACTLY what they did with jungle
Lucаs#7263,They nerfed the jg a while ago gold wise
J-Klar#4158,There is nothing wrong with having mid laners be the most impactful
J-Klar#4158,It's a choice
Lucаs#7263,I mean when people are playing characters like pyke mid there might be a problem
BlazeThief#4311,Blev
J-Klar#4158,hes an assassin?
BlazeThief#4311,Thats the same as saying any cheese pick is a problem
Aho#7784,Pyke ISN'T supposed to be there tho
Lucаs#7263,"""But the lane allows him to because it’s in the centre"
BlazeThief#4311,Not cheese pick I mean a pick in the spot they aint usually in
Lucаs#7263,"""“Fuck farming"
J-Klar#4158,bruh
Aho#7784,Just like how Vayne isn't supposed to be top
BlazeThief#4311,thats legit just pyke
BlazeThief#4311,not mid
J-Klar#4158,"""Ekko"
Lucаs#7263,Yeah but other champs can take the same play style
J-Klar#4158,All are roaming picks
J-Klar#4158,asol
J-Klar#4158,It's a type of mid laner
J-Klar#4158,They excel at creating leads around the map rather than in a 1v1
Lucаs#7263,I’m saying if they give less gold in lane it means they have to be in their own lane more often to be getting as much as they can
BlazeThief#4311,Not really
BlazeThief#4311,if they did that it would make what your talking about worse
BlazeThief#4311,if they lose lane gold
BlazeThief#4311,they will roam for gold instead
BlazeThief#4311,pyke will just go to other lanes more
Lucаs#7263,Yeah that’s it their roams work 100% of the time
Aho#7784,The losing person of that lane will NEVER recover then
Lucаs#7263,What if they roam and get nothing
Lucаs#7263,Then huge waste
BlazeThief#4311,Then they wont miss much
BlazeThief#4311,if the gold aint much
Aho#7784,Roams are not 100% you know
Lucаs#7263,That’s what I’m saying
Lucаs#7263,When their roams don’t work they get punished more
Aho#7784,no
Aho#7784,they push wave in
Aho#7784,and when they come back it's back at mid
Lucаs#7263,Because there’s not shit tones of farm waiting for them when they come back
Aho#7784,with bearly any gold lost
Aho#7784,you only roam when you can push wave in
J-Klar#4158,by nerfing gold in lane you're not punishing roaming champs you're punishing farming champs
Lucаs#7263,"""Ok"
Lucаs#7263,Doesn’t seem fair
BlazeThief#4311,Blev
J-Klar#4158,1. they dont 2. that pressure is at different times in the game
J-Klar#4158,junglers are inherently early game
Aho#7784,THEY HAVE A HARD TIME DOING IT
Lucаs#7263,And jungles don’t?
J-Klar#4158,u do level 3 ganks as a mid
J-Klar#4158,?
Aho#7784,EARLIEST is lvl 6
Lucаs#7263,U can if you play it right
Aho#7784,ATLEST
BlazeThief#4311,depending you can lol
BlazeThief#4311,talon
Lucаs#7263,Or do a cheater recall but instead of recalling roam
Aho#7784,Talon is an exception lol
Lucаs#7263,Cheater recall on third wave
Lucаs#7263,3 waves then roam
BlazeThief#4311,what is a cheater recall?
Lucаs#7263,You stack huge wave on third wave of the game so they can fast clear it
Lucаs#7263,It’s the first canon wave
Aho#7784,"""But if they roam and don't push in wave and they don't get a kill"
Aho#7784,SO
Aho#7784,you can't just roam willy nilly
Lucаs#7263,Neither can jungle?
Lucаs#7263,You have to be way more thoughtful about camp sequencing and where the enemy jg is
Aho#7784,Bro they don't have a wave to worry about
BlazeThief#4311,I legit early ganked almost every game as kayn
Aho#7784,it's not that hard to
Lucаs#7263,"""They just have 6 camps"
Lucаs#7263,Not that bad bro
Lucаs#7263,They don’t have a wave
BlazeThief#4311,4 objs?
Lucаs#7263,Scuttles count
BlazeThief#4311,not sure about that one
Lucаs#7263,People literally talk about scuttle skirmishes
Lucаs#7263,Higher elo it’s very important
BlazeThief#4311,Well yeah were all like bronze 2 highest here
Lucаs#7263,Doesn’t mean it’s not a obj
BlazeThief#4311,and if you hate the game why do you care about all of the meta stuff?
Lucаs#7263,Because that’s one of the reasons why?
BlazeThief#4311,One of the reasons you hate it?
BlazeThief#4311,You confusing me out here blev
Lucаs#7263,Meta is not fun and mid lane op
BlazeThief#4311,then dont worry about meta and play for fun
Lucаs#7263,Don’t work like that chief
BlazeThief#4311,What makes adc or top not op?
Lucаs#7263,Cuz then I get called an inter by jake and he says “don’t int my lane”
BlazeThief#4311,If jake be seriously saying that he got the issues
BlazeThief#4311,mans most likely jokin
Lucаs#7263,He was not
Lucаs#7263,It’s cuz I was playing lee sin support for his Ashe
BlazeThief#4311,@J-Klar we need the confirmation
J-Klar#4158,what are you talking about
Lucаs#7263,And he got mad
BlazeThief#4311,well of course you are legit just trolling
Lucаs#7263,Bruh
BlazeThief#4311,theres a different between having fun and you just trolling the game
Lucаs#7263,“Play for fun”
J-Klar#4158,wait what are you even talking about
BlazeThief#4311,its not fun when you are doing that
Lucаs#7263,Why is it not fun?
BlazeThief#4311,thats like me locking in ivern adc and dying
Aho#7784,Inting a mid lane is not good
Lucаs#7263,Jesus Christ Jordan
Lucаs#7263,Read the chat
Lucаs#7263,Before speaking
BlazeThief#4311,lol
Aho#7784,that sent way too late
Lucаs#7263,Why is locking in a weird pick bad if ur just playing for fun?
BlazeThief#4311,Karthik gonna come back and read a whole novel
BlazeThief#4311,Its fine if you both are gaming about it
J-Klar#4158,1. I wasn't mad and I think it was pretty clear I was joking also that happened like a month ago 2. Everytime we play you do at least 1 trolling thing even when i ask you not to. Just because you don't care to improve doesn't mean I don't
BlazeThief#4311,but if you just lock lee in and jake is just getting smacked on while you trolling him
BlazeThief#4311,it aint fun
Lucаs#7263,Because he’s losing?
Lucаs#7263,Which means he wants to win
J-Klar#4158,I don't care about winning at all
BlazeThief#4311,Well of course he wants to win its not fun sitting for 30 minutes getting you willy wacked
J-Klar#4158,I just want to play well
BlazeThief#4311,But is it fun getting willy wacked jake?
J-Klar#4158,No but it doens't matter because I wasn't mad
BlazeThief#4311,Damn I see you
Lucаs#7263,And full circle to when you asked why meta matters if u trynna have fun
BlazeThief#4311,Take back my willy wack point then
BlazeThief#4311,Its not even meta
Lucаs#7263,Because to have fun you need to be winning
J-Klar#4158,No
BlazeThief#4311,you can have fun losing
J-Klar#4158,You just need to be improving
Lucаs#7263,Not what I guys just said
Lucаs#7263,U
BlazeThief#4311,but if you want to win the game with the lads
J-Klar#4158,Anyway everyone likes different things
BlazeThief#4311,and you lock in some rando supp its scuffmeister
J-Klar#4158,"""Some people only want to win"
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah we all aint the same
Lucаs#7263,Exactly but y’all try hard in norms when I’m just trynna mess around
Aho#7784,I just want to not int
BlazeThief#4311,Try harding kinda scuffed
Lucаs#7263,Thats what norms are for
Lucаs#7263,Trying new shit
J-Klar#4158,Don't tell people what the game is for
Lucаs#7263,K
BlazeThief#4311,lol
Lucаs#7263,I mean
BlazeThief#4311,this whole thing is all for nothing
BlazeThief#4311,not really a point talking about it
Aho#7784,I just don't like playing comp
BlazeThief#4311,then dont play ranked
J-Klar#4158,Why is wanting to play well try harding
Aho#7784,that's why I play norms
Lucаs#7263,It’s not just wanting to play well it’s u literally treat unranked normals like its  lcs finals
BlazeThief#4311,LOL
J-Klar#4158,how exactly
J-Klar#4158,lmao
Aho#7784,Is wanting to win a problem?
Aho#7784,I don't think anyone wants to lose
Lucаs#7263,"""always trying to play ur best"
BlazeThief#4311,I dont think people care if you arent doing it on purpose
BlazeThief#4311,but when you playing something like lee supp it just kinda takes the fun away for the adc
J-Klar#4158,I think you have slightly annoyed mixed up with mad
Aho#7784,I don't really care if your not tryna int but if people do it on purpose I get really annoyed at that
BlazeThief#4311,think of it like this then
Lucаs#7263,All I’m saying is it’s fun to take random ass picks into lane and own with them
BlazeThief#4311,say that karthus was in your games
BlazeThief#4311,saying it was a fun thing for norms
Lucаs#7263,And you never know how they play out till u try them
BlazeThief#4311,and steals every wave as a strat
Aho#7784,That's real annoying and I would get mad at that
Lucаs#7263,If he was in my vc and told me about it I would literally go along with it if he was just memeing in norms
Lucаs#7263,I took smite as a support and took jungle camps
Lucаs#7263,It’s fun to just do weird shit
Aho#7784,I wouldn't
Aho#7784,Some people just want to play the game
Lucаs#7263,"""Never said you can’t"
BlazeThief#4311,How did this go from lucas saying he didnt like the game since the meta was funky to him saying he would rather ignore the meta and just vibe
Lucаs#7263,Because the meta punishes vibers
BlazeThief#4311,oppressed vibers
J-Klar#4158,Nobody has ever gotten mad at you for playing poorly. I just get annoyed when you take my cs after ganks while im right here or when you try to take my jungle camps
BlazeThief#4311,nah peeps defenitly have gotten mad before about taht
Lucаs#7263,Dude I gank u like 4 times 3 of which end in kills and u can’t let me have 1 canon per gank
BlazeThief#4311,just in the nature of league
J-Klar#4158,because its not a thing lucas
J-Klar#4158,I've never been mad at any of you for playing badly only myself
Lucаs#7263,All I’m saying is sacrificing one canon for 300 gold seems chill
J-Klar#4158,or as you're a support just dont take it because you dont need it
Lucаs#7263,"""No support “needs” it but it’s literally gold it’s not like it hurts me"
J-Klar#4158,so can the mid laner
Lucаs#7263,Yeah but u just got 300 gold due to a kill that I took part in so why not let me have one canon
J-Klar#4158,because it makes no sense
J-Klar#4158,its not a thing and im fine if u do it to someone else just not me
J-Klar#4158,and how do you explain the jungle camps
J-Klar#4158,what am I sacrificing them for
Lucаs#7263,What about em you played jungle maybe 2 games last 2 weeks and I never took ur camps
J-Klar#4158,Well thats notr true
Lucаs#7263,Which part taking camps or playing jg
J-Klar#4158,taking camps
Lucаs#7263,I don’t remember taking any if I did tho it might be because u are a full build Warwick and I could still use some gold as I don’t have full build
J-Klar#4158,nope wasnt full build
Lucаs#7263,Plus if anything it would be like 2 camps PER GAME maximum
Lucаs#7263,You literally never play jungle and it barely happens
Lucаs#7263,Maybe it’s because I’m used to inting random junglers so I just do it of habit
J-Klar#4158,why would you int anybody
J-Klar#4158,trying off meta quirky stuff is fine. inting them is just ruining their experience
Lucаs#7263,The junglers ARE inting I’m not inting them
Lucаs#7263,Plus why does any of this matter because in 3 months from now you will remember none of this
J-Klar#4158,you bought this all up
Lucаs#7263,Nah u brought up the “you steal my Cs”
J-Klar#4158,you told merak that i got mad when you picked something off meta as my support
Lucаs#7263,Because he asked me why care about meta why not play for fun so I gave him answer
J-Klar#4158,but why answer its not gonna matter in 3 months
Lucаs#7263,Why not?
J-Klar#4158,exactly so why not care right now about the cs stealing
Lucаs#7263,"""My whole point of not caring is that if it gets you worked up and shit"
Aho#7784,SO how did it become WE NEED TO NURF MID GOLD to this?
J-Klar#4158,hardly worked up
J-Klar#4158,just said im annoyed
Lucаs#7263,Ok change that with annoyed then point still stands
J-Klar#4158,why care about anything that doesn't matter in the long term then
Lucаs#7263,"""annoyance isn't a good feeling so why let yourself feel that way if you wont remember it. but on the other hand"
J-Klar#4158,you're talking about not having negative emotions
J-Klar#4158,kinda hard
J-Klar#4158,and also its hypocritical
Lucаs#7263,"""practice makes perfect"
Lucаs#7263,never said im the best at it
J-Klar#4158,then neither am I
J-Klar#4158,Also I dont think anybody should be
J-Klar#4158,You're allowed to feel negativley about something small but thats not the same as sweating about it
Lucаs#7263,sure
Lucаs#7263,all im saying is league does not matter
Lucаs#7263,so why get annoyed by it when im just trying to enjoy myself in the moment
J-Klar#4158,because u enjoying urself in the moment hurts my enjoyment
Lucаs#7263,"""well i cant make u not get annoyed by me taking one creep when i gank u and help u get a kill"
J-Klar#4158,"""just do it to someone else"
Lucаs#7263,what?
Lucаs#7263,since when is taking one cs inting tho
Lucаs#7263,"""and when you said """"its just not a thing"""" its literally called taxing"""
J-Klar#4158,As a jungler
J-Klar#4158,yes lol
Lucаs#7263,"""and as a support you can do the same thing"
J-Klar#4158,Also taxing lanes is kinda a meme but whatever I really dont care this much about so whatever ur right about whatever the point of this was
Lucаs#7263,k
Lucаs#7263,definitely derailed quite a bit there but my main point about the way I feel about the game was that every game of league makes me feel different about it so that's why I always change my mind.\
J-Klar#4158,AHAHHAH
J-Klar#4158,it literally came out on the exact minute
J-Klar#4158,wait its half out

Aho#7784,tho they basically have the same passive and Q.... Tho Yone Passive is better and Yas Q is better
Aho#7784,Actually Yone Q might be better
Aho#7784,who knows
Aho#7784,The Cinematic looks SICK tho
BlazeThief#4311,Yasuo is better for poke
BlazeThief#4311,Yone better for engage
BlazeThief#4311,for their q
BlazeThief#4311,at least thats how it kinda looked
BlazeThief#4311,the mans has a dash as the q passive right?

Lucаs#7263,masks tho
BlazeThief#4311,then tech design and stuff nasty
BlazeThief#4311,as
karthiccc#0069,when enetering classes you will have to use hand sanitizer too
Aho#7784,Mask isn't that bad

BlazeThief#4311,glasses
BlazeThief#4311,get cucked
karthiccc#0069,most likely last name jordan
Lucаs#7263,everyone will get a mask that looks like someone elses face
Aho#7784,are they gonna do it by last names or grades
Lucаs#7263,then we swap
karthiccc#0069,last name
karthiccc#0069,jordan
J-Klar#4158,blev imagine grades
J-Klar#4158,ahahha
BlazeThief#4311,lmao
karthiccc#0069,they cant
J-Klar#4158,retards in one place
Aho#7784,like grade 9 and 12
BlazeThief#4311,that would be so many peeps
Aho#7784,and grade 10 and 11
J-Klar#4158,oh
J-Klar#4158,that kind
karthiccc#0069,"""well heres the thing"
J-Klar#4158,ignore what i said
karthiccc#0069,cant do that with grade seperation
J-Klar#4158,no reatds here
Lucаs#7263,well karthik they could because there would be more vacant rooms
Lucаs#7263,but less teachers so they wouldnt have enough teacher to go round
karthiccc#0069,they dont have 2 physics teachers
karthiccc#0069,or chem teachers
Aho#7784,I think there gonna probably do both
Lucаs#7263,yeah thats only problem
karthiccc#0069,not enough staff lucas
karthiccc#0069,they literally cant do both
karthiccc#0069,last name is honestly the only real option
Lucаs#7263,nah they sort us by dick size
karthiccc#0069,well then shit
karthiccc#0069,imma be stuck with lucas
Lucаs#7263,leggo
Aho#7784,but they will be teaching like 4 different grades
Lucаs#7263,tinydickgang
Aho#7784,splitting it up by grades would be better or a combo of both
karthiccc#0069,"""yeah but jordan"
karthiccc#0069,they want everyone to go forward at the same time
J-Klar#4158,ah i wont have the boys to back me up in physics class
Aho#7784,cause they're gonna have 2 different groups anyways
J-Klar#4158,man hates me
Aho#7784,grades would be better
karthiccc#0069,jordan it will get mixed up and weird when holidays come into play and snowdays if they happen
karthiccc#0069,and strike days
Lucаs#7263,jake just lose the accent adn shave urself bald and he wont know its you
J-Klar#4158,true
Aho#7784,wdym by that Karthik?
J-Klar#4158,until i game on him
karthiccc#0069,think about it
karthiccc#0069,if they split by grade
Aho#7784,we still have school online on the days we have off
Lucаs#7263,then reveal your nefarious plot at the end
karthiccc#0069,one grade gonna get more time in class than the other
karthiccc#0069,oh true you right about that
J-Klar#4158,damn lucas

J-Klar#4158,cohortation
karthiccc#0069,how do you half a grade 11 physics class that is 30 students
Aho#7784,but it's better than having 4 different grades take math at the same time
J-Klar#4158,hybrid learning systematics
karthiccc#0069,JORDAN THEY WANT SMALLER CLASS SIZE
karthiccc#0069,NOT HOW MANNY PEOPLE ARE DOING A SUBJECT

J-Klar#4158,nothing is gonna be perfect
J-Klar#4158,blame china
J-Klar#4158,bat poop swallowers
Aho#7784,take Advance function.... it'll always be in the first sem if you took calculus then they can just make 2 classes for 1 week with like 10-15 people in each class and have the same for the other the week after
J-Klar#4158,it wont necessary be first sem
J-Klar#4158,it could be second
karthiccc#0069,it is always first sem
Aho#7784,^^^

karthiccc#0069,you need advanced functions to do calc
J-Klar#4158,theres 4
J-Klar#4158,1 and 2
J-Klar#4158,are grouped
J-Klar#4158,as long as their in different sets
Aho#7784,yeah 4 separate classes for each sem
karthiccc#0069,im so confused
J-Klar#4158,it could be 3 4 no?

J-Klar#4158,no i know its just confirming of my fear that no one will ever like me back
J-Klar#4158,its the principle of the matter

BlazeThief#4311,yeah jake in your case
J-Klar#4158,lets be real I was waiting for 100% chance
BlazeThief#4311,I dont think that was a problem with you and more her
J-Klar#4158,I honestly thought shed say yes
BlazeThief#4311,maybe her feelings were just kinda scuffed
Aho#7784,But she just went like so ummm was it obvious that I like you?
J-Klar#4158,i doubt it
BlazeThief#4311,how else would it work?
J-Klar#4158,shes not in the wrong for not liking me
BlazeThief#4311,she isnt
J-Klar#4158,im just a weird person
BlazeThief#4311,how?
Aho#7784,you're not
BlazeThief#4311,you aint making sense here
BlazeThief#4311,she liked you
Aho#7784,then she didn't
BlazeThief#4311,but when you asked her out she said she wanted to be friends right?
J-Klar#4158,yes
BlazeThief#4311,so maybe her feelings were just wack
BlazeThief#4311,not as in liking you is wack
Aho#7784,Tbh was I the only one that got the vibes that those two liked each other when we were still in school?
BlazeThief#4311,I did

Lucаs#7263,jus keep vibin jake u never know when god will put sonmeone on ur plate

BlazeThief#4311,since this stuff
BlazeThief#4311,nah jordan that kinda scuff head
Aho#7784,but then it also might put him into a worst position

BlazeThief#4311,mans be simping then
Aho#7784,so gamble away

Aho#7784,you guys are really close friends
BlazeThief#4311,I can see why

BlazeThief#4311,depends
BlazeThief#4311,I could have fun in some if I feel like I can improve
Aho#7784,true
BlazeThief#4311,but team games and league especially just feel like such a coin toss
BlazeThief#4311,like I could be a gamer chad
BlazeThief#4311,but some lad like the last game we played is like
BlazeThief#4311,you banned yone
BlazeThief#4311,so im gonna int into tower

BlazeThief#4311,the thing is thou

J-Klar#4158,Who cares
BlazeThief#4311,but someone can just as easily int
Aho#7784,you can but if your other team mates ints then that's the issue
Lucаs#7263,I just think almost any FPS outclasses league I just find them more fun
Aho#7784,Not really
J-Klar#4158,Obviously that used to be me
Lucаs#7263,Like I’ve had more fun in seige and cargo than league
Lucаs#7263,Csgo
J-Klar#4158,But something changed
Lucаs#7263,U can still use gamesense
J-Klar#4158,I just love how much there is to learn in league
J-Klar#4158,There is just so much you can do to be better than the enemy
Aho#7784,yeah but I just like how you don't that much game mechanics to be good at league
Lucаs#7263,Same thing in fps
J-Klar#4158,Too less of an extent
BlazeThief#4311,jake gotta try a fighting game
Aho#7784,Fighting games are fun
BlazeThief#4311,learning new crap
BlazeThief#4311,outplaying
J-Klar#4158,Even siege didn't have even close to the amount of stuff to learn and be better at
BlazeThief#4311,learning how to play a character to outplay others
Aho#7784,^^^
BlazeThief#4311,there is so much crap to learn
Aho#7784,being able to 2 shot someone
BlazeThief#4311,and most of the skill can transfer to other games
BlazeThief#4311,thats just fighterz lmao
J-Klar#4158,Like I said I'll wait for the league fighting game

karthiccc#0069,true
BlazeThief#4311,how we know for sure doe
J-Klar#4158,The times wouldn't align
karthiccc#0069,"""also jordan I have everything with you minus eng"
Lucаs#7263,What does cohort even mean

BlazeThief#4311,me and the bois are like romeo and juliet

Lucаs#7263,How does it work
J-Klar#4158,The different side of the alphabet
J-Klar#4158,Up to m
J-Klar#4158,Last names
karthiccc#0069,"""educational cohorts (a group of people who begin schooling or an educational program at the same time"
Lucаs#7263,Yeah but if the ppl in commtech are only like 7 ppl they not gonna split them up just do one tiny class
J-Klar#4158,But the scheduling is different
karthiccc#0069,oh shit
J-Klar#4158,It wouldn't align
karthiccc#0069,cohort means same age
karthiccc#0069,so same year basically
J-Klar#4158,Oh?
Lucаs#7263,Where can I read up on this garbage
Aho#7784,so they are doing it by grades?
karthiccc#0069,"""probably if they meant it when they used the word """"cohort"""""""
karthiccc#0069,"""*In education"
karthiccc#0069,so we a cohort
J-Klar#4158,I dont think thats hiw they're doing it though
karthiccc#0069,maybe
J-Klar#4158,here is what they write about it
karthiccc#0069,but thats just what the word means
J-Klar#4158,They don't really say how it will be sorted
J-Klar#4158,Last names would make sense though
J-Klar#4158,Considering thats how they do most things
karthiccc#0069,ok then yeah makes sense
karthiccc#0069,weird they used the word cohort tho
karthiccc#0069,like just say group?
Lucаs#7263,"""They gonna send us a google form"

Lucаs#7263,"""One step for man"
J-Klar#4158,i mean u can just download the mobile one externally
Lucаs#7263,Not as easy on ios tho u need to be jailbroken
Lucаs#7263,Plus it def reduces playerbase just because of accessibility
Aho#7784,Why are you so excited for that?
Aho#7784,We all know that game is dead
Lucаs#7263,Nah still one of the highest viewed games on twitch. But this is the start of an era without fortnite
J-Klar#4158,Eh its pretty dead
J-Klar#4158,it used to be unavoidable
J-Klar#4158,sure it still gets high views
J-Klar#4158,but its just not the same
Lucаs#7263,I look forward to a world without fortnite
J-Klar#4158,True
Lucаs#7263,Although I’m happy it was made
karthiccc#0069,"""technically you could say"
karthiccc#0069,so I agree I'm also happy it was made
J-Klar#4158,I dont think thats true
BlazeThief#4311,The only reason it was taken off was because they put vbucks on sale for some big sale event thing
BlazeThief#4311,and apparently you cant do that on mobile stores since it goes through them
BlazeThief#4311,so apple and android were like
Pizzanat#6176,"""but it wasn't just a sale"
BlazeThief#4311,ooooooo really??
BlazeThief#4311,my bad then
BlazeThief#4311,that probably makes it even worse
BlazeThief#4311,since then apple and androids prices are scuffed in comparison
J-Klar#4158,new avengers game looks kinda cool
Aho#7784,Ik apple could do sales cause of Gotcha games lmao

Aho#7784,tell the yas to hit his 0-10 power spike
karthiccc#0069,ok done
Lucаs#7263,Bruh that’s a blev moment
Lucаs#7263,I think rocket league is going f2p on August 31st because that’s when the new battle pass starts
Lucаs#7263,What a garbage company “free to play on August”
Lucаs#7263,Literally the last day of August that is
J-Klar#4158,bruh
J-Klar#4158,who cares
Lucаs#7263,It’s just a scummy thing to do
Lucаs#7263,Get ppl hyped up for august release when it’s literally the end of August
Lucаs#7263,"""They did the same thing with fortnite STW said it was gonna be free hyped it up"
BlazeThief#4311,jake really be hating just to hate out here
Lucаs#7263,Epic games truly is such a scummy company
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah it aint good
BlazeThief#4311,wonder if ill be able to import it onto steam
Lucаs#7263,Probably but you’ll still need the egs open and adding friends prob be on egs
BlazeThief#4311,dangg
J-Klar#4158,not hating just to hate lmao I just think its scuffed that you would call them scummy when they're literally making the game f2p
BlazeThief#4311,ay my guy if they scummy they scummy aint no other way aboot it
Lucаs#7263,Jake I didn’t even call them scummy when u said that
Lucаs#7263,My main point is that it’s pretty misleading to say free in August when it’s August 31st. Imagine people exited to play waiting every day because they didn’t give an official date to find out it’s on the last possible day.
J-Klar#4158,well u called them garbage
J-Klar#4158,which is what I meant
J-Klar#4158,mb
J-Klar#4158,hey man at least it aint fortnite
J-Klar#4158,STW f2p in 2018 AHAHAAHAH
J-Klar#4158,Nearly 3 years later...
BlazeThief#4311,they had a whole video thing for the apple and andrioid store thing lol
Lucаs#7263,I mean isn’t it because they have their own payment method? Like if they dropped the prices and continued to let Apple handle the payment methods I still think it would be in the App Store
Lucаs#7263,They say “everyone should have the choice of payment providers” but the company is just trying to make more money themselves
BlazeThief#4311,yeah they made a thing so that they get the money instead
Lucаs#7263,Because they provide 20% discount by paying directly to epic games and avoiding 30% Apple fee
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
Lucаs#7263,Then they throw Apple under the bus
Lucаs#7263,They agreed to those terms when they put the game in the store
Lucаs#7263,Literal scum my guy
maximumeffort1#3058,i find it hilarious
maximumeffort1#3058,its so dumb
karthiccc#0069,@maximumeffort1 who you playing fortnite with

karthiccc#0069,that could be interesting
karthiccc#0069,yeah

Lucаs#7263,the multiplayer for that would be interesting
karthiccc#0069,very weird

BlazeThief#4311,thats the first time they brought an outside mans in right thats pretty gamer
Pizzanat#6176,yee
Pizzanat#6176,and a lot of stuff too
Pizzanat#6176,"""like 1.5x"
Pizzanat#6176,defenders get 1.5x
Pizzanat#6176,and secondary hard breaching gadget
Pizzanat#6176,and funnny pinging
Pizzanat#6176,and new guy has mp7 acog
Pizzanat#6176,and chalet rework
Lucаs#7263,Big wack update
Lucаs#7263,Gotta download test server cuz that goes up tmrw
Lucаs#7263,I’m most exited for optic changes tbh
Pizzanat#6176,i'll download it for tomorrow too then
Lucаs#7263,Nvm it’s lookin kinda sketch actually
Lucаs#7263,They took away docs acog
Lucаs#7263,But they kept it on rook
Pizzanat#6176,wait they did?
Lucаs#7263,Scopes don’t depend on the gun anymore just the op
Pizzanat#6176,pretty much
Lucаs#7263,Castle got new 1.5
Lucаs#7263,Pulse didn’t
Pizzanat#6176,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm fun
karthiccc#0069,yo castle main time
Pizzanat#6176,he also has the super shorty and lucas' favourite: the proximity alarms
Lucаs#7263,I’m just wondering what scope bosg gets
Pizzanat#6176,better be the 12x/5x
karthiccc#0069,16x scope
Pizzanat#6176,or that
karthiccc#0069,it better be
karthiccc#0069,it is the better scope
karthiccc#0069,no doubt
Lucаs#7263,Uuh nvm they removed ALL acogs from Defense except bosg
karthiccc#0069,wait really?
Lucаs#7263,The original acog is 2.5x
Pizzanat#6176,so they only have 1.5x?
karthiccc#0069,bruh
Pizzanat#6176,and acog is now 2.0x
karthiccc#0069,rip doc
karthiccc#0069,and rook
Lucаs#7263,Ye
Lucаs#7263,2.0x
karthiccc#0069,scuffed
Pizzanat#6176,wHaT iF sOmEoNe WaNtS tO pLaY tHe HeAlEr?
Lucаs#7263,So if the kept the acog it’s only 2.0x now or they might’ve just got it removed like me boi doc
Lucаs#7263,But more ppl get 1.5x scope so all around if you played someone without acog it’s great
Lucаs#7263,But if I played someone for their acog it’s getting nerfed a
Pizzanat#6176,but now you don't have to play them for the acog
Pizzanat#6176,because you basically kind of not really maybe probably get a scope that can replace it but probably not but oh well maybe
J-Klar#4158,link?
J-Klar#4158,mp7 on attack?
J-Klar#4158,uh oh
J-Klar#4158,thank you
J-Klar#4158,thats what i wanted to see
Lucаs#7263,This compares just the scopes and stuff
J-Klar#4158,new scopes looking good
J-Klar#4158,why in the world they give acog to mp7?
Lucаs#7263,It’s weird how they aren’t all getting updated tho
J-Klar#4158,Is that mp5 scope the 3x?
Lucаs#7263,2x
Lucаs#7263,So it went down 0.5 and doc only has 1.5
J-Klar#4158,god the new new holographic kinda ugly
Lucаs#7263,I just think it’s weird how they make all these nice new scopes yet a lot of guns still have the old scopes
J-Klar#4158,u mean up 0.5?
Lucаs#7263,No the new scope for mp5 is 2.0x
Lucаs#7263,OG acog was 2.5x
J-Klar#4158,it was?
J-Klar#4158,damn
Lucаs#7263,Ye
Lucаs#7263,Only defender gun that retained og acog was bosg
Lucаs#7263,So that has longest scope on Defense now
J-Klar#4158,which guns have the new 3x?
J-Klar#4158,also the new red dot is banging
Lucаs#7263,I think only attack dmrs
Lucаs#7263,Have 3x
J-Klar#4158,ok
Lucаs#7263,But I think nozzle just has mostly old scopes
Lucаs#7263,Like he don’t even get the sexy new ones
J-Klar#4158,1.5x is good too
Lucаs#7263,Yes cuz now a lot of ppl that used to have 1x get 1.5 like wamai castle
Lucаs#7263,So if u played non acog defenders it’s big buff
J-Klar#4158,AHHH U CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR
Lucаs#7263,Yeye
J-Klar#4158,what about jager
J-Klar#4158,does he get 1.5?
Lucаs#7263,Nope
J-Klar#4158,so i have to use the shitty holo
Lucаs#7263,I think just updated  RDS
J-Klar#4158,Oh
J-Klar#4158,thats good enough
J-Klar#4158,the new red dot hella nmoice
Lucаs#7263,Then og holo og reflex
J-Klar#4158,is all this stuff on the pbs
Lucаs#7263,No
J-Klar#4158,blev
Lucаs#7263,It’s on the test server tomorrow
J-Klar#4158,ah
Lucаs#7263,Idk what pbs is
J-Klar#4158,i mean test server
J-Klar#4158,it was typo
J-Klar#4158,pts
J-Klar#4158,changes be good
Lucаs#7263,Yeah but a lot of people just kept old scopes I wish every op got every zoom type
J-Klar#4158,eh
Lucаs#7263,Like if they want lager to be 1x only give him all 1x scopes
J-Klar#4158,oh
J-Klar#4158,ye
Lucаs#7263,It’s just personal preference so I don’t see the harm
Lucаs#7263,Oh and capitao is a hard breacher now so I will main him even more
J-Klar#4158,...
J-Klar#4158,wtf
Pizzanat#6176,and nokk

Lucаs#7263,And jasper the saddest loss of all: gridlock and capi LMGS lose
Lucаs#7263,Scope
J-Klar#4158,they get acog or 1.5x?
Lucаs#7263,They get all scopes except 3x
J-Klar#4158,damn
Lucаs#7263,But they lose “scope”
Lucаs#7263,It was simple and beautiful
J-Klar#4158,eh
Lucаs#7263,Scope

J-Klar#4158,Pooping
karthiccc#0069,ah
J-Klar#4158,Kill me
J-Klar#4158,I made the perfect ryze build
J-Klar#4158,"""3k health"
karthiccc#0069,But thats full build
Lucаs#7263,Yeah that’s the point
Lucаs#7263,And jake there is no perfect build
J-Klar#4158,I meant that it cover all bases
J-Klar#4158,Pretty sure it's the most balanced and best fitting
Lucаs#7263,Yeah but it will never be optimal
J-Klar#4158,Perfect in the sense of balance is what I meant
Lucаs#7263,I guess
J-Klar#4158,It does as much dmg as full ap due to mana scalings
J-Klar#4158,While having massive resist
J-Klar#4158,And gauntlet let's u stay in range to dps
J-Klar#4158,And you never run out of mana
Lucаs#7263,Only thing is every game is so different that u might need qss because fed more or u might need adaptive helm or whatever for teemo/cas
Lucаs#7263,I’d say it’s very rare you would actually build that build
J-Klar#4158,Not really
J-Klar#4158,Even against teemo u would build abyssal
J-Klar#4158,ur not a tank
J-Klar#4158,so u dont need to get adaptive
J-Klar#4158,the mr and hp is enough
J-Klar#4158,and if u dont need armor u go mask and veil
J-Klar#4158,and if u dont need mr u go heart and gauntlet
J-Klar#4158,I thought I sent an image
Lucаs#7263,Abyssal is what I meant do u have that in build?
J-Klar#4158,That was build
Lucаs#7263,But it’s exactly what I mean when u say “if u don’t need x get y”
J-Klar#4158,Ye but its a good basis build where you would only really switch out on item depending on their dmg source
Lucаs#7263,it’s good as a guideline but one of the reasons I’m bad and can’t climb is definitely poor itemization
Lucаs#7263,Like if ur doing really good why not throw in mej
J-Klar#4158,Well it depends on the character
J-Klar#4158,you only really go mej on characters where you can guarantee the snowball
J-Klar#4158,so mainly assasins
J-Klar#4158,plus on ryze it doesnt make as much sense cuz u can just build mana and get ap from seraph
J-Klar#4158,like with this seraph was giving over 200 ap
Lucаs#7263,Well yeah don’t swap it for seraph
Lucаs#7263,That’s like fire item for him
Lucаs#7263,Core
J-Klar#4158,nah I just mean u dont build it at all
J-Klar#4158,mej only brings the ap which ryze doesnt need as much because he isnt burst
J-Klar#4158,hes dps
Lucаs#7263,What if they have big magic resist boots aren’t gunna get u the pen u need
J-Klar#4158,I dont really think that applies to ryze cuz hes dps right
J-Klar#4158,i mean if its that bad you could drop one of the tank items
Lucаs#7263,"""Idk man I don’t really look at full builds anymore if there’s a core item that someone needs of course get it"
Lucаs#7263,"""Like some games on pyke I skip qss"
J-Klar#4158,well ofc
J-Klar#4158,but in games where no special itemization is needed I was saying it is the strongest build
Lucаs#7263,Sure makes sense soon you’ll have to redo all these builds because item rework
Lucаs#7263,Uncapped CD-R
J-Klar#4158,f
J-Klar#4158,Tho
J-Klar#4158,this build would be even better when that happens
J-Klar#4158,cuz it had a huge excess of cdr
J-Klar#4158,and millions of cdr on ryze would be soooo nice
J-Klar#4158,so hyped for the new items
J-Klar#4158,the system they have right now is so stale
Lucаs#7263,Although aren’t they deleting old items and adding new ones? I thought they said 1/3 new 1/3 reworked 1/3 old
Lucаs#7263,So some items won’t even be the same
J-Klar#4158,idk
Lucаs#7263,I kinda like the item system rn it’s fine
J-Klar#4158,its just boring
Lucаs#7263,There’s an answer to almost everything
J-Klar#4158,you just build the same crap with maybe a couple different items each game
Lucаs#7263,Yeah idrc tho it’s just one less thing to focus on
J-Klar#4158,I like them having a bunch of stuff
J-Klar#4158,you can always get better
J-Klar#4158,there is always a way to beat other players
Lucаs#7263,"""I’m done with league in the competitive sense it’s just too much work"
J-Klar#4158,ye i dont play ranked
J-Klar#4158,doesnt mean i dont like to be better
Lucаs#7263,The new league is much better

J-Klar#4158,How do you see a whole week at a time tho

J-Klar#4158,You have to begin work on the 8th
maximumeffort1#3058,This is going to be a shit show

J-Klar#4158,Look at the video I sent
J-Klar#4158,You stay with the same people
J-Klar#4158,which is a little odd
J-Klar#4158,I dont understand that
Lucаs#7263,wtf like u just roam around with a group like middle school
J-Klar#4158,how would they find 15 people who have the exact same chedule

BlazeThief#4311,my family was looking at this earlier
BlazeThief#4311,and its hella scuffed
Lucаs#7263,maybe we gunna make that switch
BlazeThief#4311,you have to leave the bathroom if there are 3 peeps in there
BlazeThief#4311,you cant leave your class at all until you are dissmissed
BlazeThief#4311,and if they find you out you can get suspended
BlazeThief#4311,and you have to do a check every morning at the proper door
BlazeThief#4311,and if you are at all sick you cant enter
maximumeffort1#3058,This is gay
BlazeThief#4311,but like
J-Klar#4158,"""Students will sit in their assigned seats"
BlazeThief#4311,if I have a runny nose just from like allergies are they not letting me in???
Lucаs#7263,*the escapists 3: school edition*
BlazeThief#4311,this legit feels like prison
Lucаs#7263,you ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE UNTILL ROLL CALL IS OVEr
Lucаs#7263,I MEAN ATTENDANCE
BlazeThief#4311,Like blev
BlazeThief#4311,imagine having a shite teacher aswell
BlazeThief#4311,you are stuck with them all day every day
maximumeffort1#3058,Ugh
Lucаs#7263,i mean except for when u get a week off
BlazeThief#4311,can we even switch?
maximumeffort1#3058,What if you get an ass class
BlazeThief#4311,or can we only do that when we actually have gone
Lucаs#7263,yeah they said u can switch from either seamlessly
BlazeThief#4311,aight
BlazeThief#4311,i took comp science again
BlazeThief#4311,wonder what will happen then
maximumeffort1#3058,Switch what
Lucаs#7263,true bcause certain days are assigned to courses so if the course is elearning do we just not go in?
Lucаs#7263,BALLEr if that is
BlazeThief#4311,also
BlazeThief#4311,I HATE
maximumeffort1#3058,I don’t understand
BlazeThief#4311,that you have to stay in for lunch
BlazeThief#4311,like blev
BlazeThief#4311,im just going to sit there
BlazeThief#4311,and not eat
BlazeThief#4311,and do nothing
BlazeThief#4311,and have to just wait
BlazeThief#4311,until they say I can leave
maximumeffort1#3058,How tf am I going to elearn for art
J-Klar#4158,yall know that the school day ends at like 1 tho right
J-Klar#4158,or at least the in school
BlazeThief#4311,i was leaving at one before aswell
J-Klar#4158,well yeah
J-Klar#4158,not really what I meant
J-Klar#4158,i mean before e learning
BlazeThief#4311,if I didnt have to have lunch and could have just done school work then I would have
BlazeThief#4311,they are just making you waste 45 minutes if you dont eat thou
BlazeThief#4311,like I could just do school work then
J-Klar#4158,I dont understand how the system works
BlazeThief#4311,its so scuffed
maximumeffort1#3058,You cant leave for lunch?
BlazeThief#4311,noppe
Lucаs#7263,it doesnst work
J-Klar#4158,How could you possibly be wih the same 15 people
BlazeThief#4311,stuck in your seat
BlazeThief#4311,and in your class
J-Klar#4158,They dont have the same classes
BlazeThief#4311,and get suspended if you leave
maximumeffort1#3058,This shiz sucks
maximumeffort1#3058,Well I got 8 days until school
J-Klar#4158,9
BlazeThief#4311,nah 9
BlazeThief#4311,i dont know what thing im part of
J-Klar#4158,im excited ngl
BlazeThief#4311,im not
BlazeThief#4311,you are cringe
J-Klar#4158,this looks interesting as hell
BlazeThief#4311,its looking like a dumpster fire
J-Klar#4158,ye
J-Klar#4158,interesting
J-Klar#4158,i just feel bad for new grade 9s
J-Klar#4158,gonan be scuffed for them
maximumeffort1#3058,I really hope it isn’t like this all year
BlazeThief#4311,are any of yall switching?
J-Klar#4158,switching what
maximumeffort1#3058,Switching what
BlazeThief#4311,from in person hybrid ting to online
J-Klar#4158,god no
maximumeffort1#3058,Nah
BlazeThief#4311,lol
maximumeffort1#3058,I cant stand online
J-Klar#4158,i wont do it
BlazeThief#4311,Id rather do online then this honestly
maximumeffort1#3058,I hope dylans in my cohort
J-Klar#4158,nvm im dumb
J-Klar#4158,the only have to grab people with 2 of the same classes
J-Klar#4158,because for each quadmester you only have two classes
J-Klar#4158,This helps me understand a lot
J-Klar#4158,Other than the 2 initial days you go for 5
J-Klar#4158,and then e learn for 5
J-Klar#4158,cycle between 1 of your two classes
J-Klar#4158,but for the duration you will be with the same people
J-Klar#4158,until this ends then you do the same thing with your next two classes
J-Klar#4158,meaning the cohorts will change I guess
J-Klar#4158,Oh they describe it awfully I think
J-Klar#4158,So obviously each grade will be split into cohort a and b
J-Klar#4158,but what they dont mention is the sub homerooms you will have
J-Klar#4158,except your homeroom is now your constant room
J-Klar#4158,Scuff head you have to play person and and teach roulette
J-Klar#4158,fingers crossed i get some gamers
BlazeThief#4311,so what im hearing is
BlazeThief#4311,im going to be stuck in a room with a bunch of randos
BlazeThief#4311,all alone
BlazeThief#4311,with most likely a bad teacher
maximumeffort1#3058,Ey I might be in your class
BlazeThief#4311,not if we are in different cohert things
maximumeffort1#3058,I have a lot of similar classes as you
BlazeThief#4311,or whatever their called
maximumeffort1#3058,Same with Dylan
J-Klar#4158,this is so awful
maximumeffort1#3058,Well we may be in the same cohort since were in the same area
J-Klar#4158,each day for 5 days in a row
BlazeThief#4311,is that how it works?
J-Klar#4158,you do the same class
J-Klar#4158,and yes merak
J-Klar#4158,its based off living area
J-Klar#4158,and then off two of your classes
J-Klar#4158,Im not sure how e learning courses will work tho
J-Klar#4158,Because you cant leave early
J-Klar#4158,which is a lil dumb
BlazeThief#4311,what im wondering
BlazeThief#4311,is on the one thing I read
BlazeThief#4311,it said that they dismiss you
BlazeThief#4311,then we have hybrid learning
BlazeThief#4311,legit the second we are dismissed
J-Klar#4158,well yeah
J-Klar#4158,but u have to remember how lenient it will be
BlazeThief#4311,so do they expect us to just be at home instantly if they are doing zoom crap or something?
BlazeThief#4311,ah
J-Klar#4158,Obiviously not merak
maximumeffort1#3058,Oh god
J-Klar#4158,the teachers arent retarded
maximumeffort1#3058,We have to do zoom crap
J-Klar#4158,and there wont be any zoom meanting
J-Klar#4158,Lets just say there were some problems...
J-Klar#4158,with students
J-Klar#4158,'handing out' the room codes on twitter....
J-Klar#4158,They wouldnt need to do zoom meetings anyway
J-Klar#4158,cuz whatever they need to say they would've in the over 3 hours they have per class a day
J-Klar#4158,you have the entire day just for one class
J-Klar#4158,Tbh the e learningi part will just be there to finish work if you didn't in calss
maximumeffort1#3058,Man this is a big let down
BlazeThief#4311,oh yeah
J-Klar#4158,Idk dude
BlazeThief#4311,you have to sign out sheet to use the bathroom
BlazeThief#4311,blev
J-Klar#4158,Who tf goes to the bathroom???

J-Klar#4158,Still haven't been since I came to jacb [poggers
maximumeffort1#3058,We’ll just have to see it to believe it
J-Klar#4158,the good thing is
J-Klar#4158,that you dont have to sit near anyone
maximumeffort1#3058,Nah
J-Klar#4158,and you dont really have to interact with anyone at all
maximumeffort1#3058,I wanna vibe with my friends
J-Klar#4158,cuz of social distancing
J-Klar#4158,yeah but if u dont have any in you class its chilly beans

J-Klar#4158,Just meet them irl?
J-Klar#4158,like rn
BlazeThief#4311,honestly better off doing online and discording with the bois while doing school than this for social interaction
maximumeffort1#3058,Bruh my friends don’t go outside

J-Klar#4158,The bar at the bottom being on s
karthiccc#0069,oh thats the style bar thing
J-Klar#4158,But your ultimate is up passively whenever its there. At least thats what it seems to be
karthiccc#0069,scuffed
Aho#7784,how you get that to an S?
karthiccc#0069,damage?
J-Klar#4158,Using abilities on peeps
karthiccc#0069,kills?
karthiccc#0069,oh
Aho#7784,ohhh
Aho#7784,she sounds kinda broken
Aho#7784,ngl
karthiccc#0069,you better have to do the fucking wombo combo to get that because if you can just tap a couple buttons and get it then ya broken
Aho#7784,late games you will be just hitting random buttons
BlazeThief#4311,ay my guy
BlazeThief#4311,you can not tell me yone is cool
BlazeThief#4311,man is legit yasuo again
BlazeThief#4311,he also looked and felt very clunky when I tried him
Aho#7784,at the beginning yeah
Aho#7784,but when you get more items and the attack speed goes up
Aho#7784,not really
BlazeThief#4311,eh
BlazeThief#4311,man just doesnt look fun to me
Aho#7784,but Yas is better
BlazeThief#4311,he is legit just abunch of champs thrown together
BlazeThief#4311,doesnt have fiddle e as one of his abilities
Aho#7784,lmao
BlazeThief#4311,or whichever one is the slash
Aho#7784,w
BlazeThief#4311,yeah that one
BlazeThief#4311,like blev
Aho#7784,he's not that fun to play ngl
BlazeThief#4311,exactly
BlazeThief#4311,was a major let down
BlazeThief#4311,after the cinematics and such
Aho#7784,BUT the braindead monkey however
BlazeThief#4311,lillia feels way more fun
Aho#7784,he's so ffun
BlazeThief#4311,Samira looked kinda weird
BlazeThief#4311,not sure how shes working there
BlazeThief#4311,like it had some weird letters in her trailer thing
BlazeThief#4311,and she was doing stuff depending on them
Aho#7784,ngl she doesn't look that hard to play
BlazeThief#4311,are any characters supposed to be super hard though
Aho#7784,her abilities is a dash that is like lucian
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,but she has some weird aphelios weapon switch thign going on
Aho#7784,a spin that destroy CC projectiles
Aho#7784,and a slash that does dmg and her ult
BlazeThief#4311,wonder if she has a genji dash reset
Aho#7784,probably per kill
BlazeThief#4311,guess well just have to wait for the full ability thing
Aho#7784,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,wonder if it will be like if you use a certain ability after another something else will happen
BlazeThief#4311,like combos or something
Aho#7784,i don't think she changes weapons like aphelios
Aho#7784,I think it's just her abilities
Aho#7784,and like thresh basic attacks depending on how close you are to a champ
BlazeThief#4311,well isnt her sword also a gun?
Aho#7784,yeah but I think that the sword is for close quarters and gun for normal range
Aho#7784,for basic attacks but who knows
BlazeThief#4311,was it said shes gonna be adc?
J-Klar#4158,Yes
BlazeThief#4311,gamerchads
BlazeThief#4311,is there raids and stuff in that star wars mmo or how does end game stuff work in it?
J-Klar#4158,Idk I haven't played much of it

J-Klar#4158,i just really like star wars
J-Klar#4158,but when i finish with the story stuff (but tbf its so humungus i doubt that will happen) ill let u know lol

karthiccc#0069,Merak you minimum 5'11
BlazeThief#4311,not sure if it was just that they measured and I didnt stand up straight or something or they just saucing lies my way
karthiccc#0069,177 cm = 5.8 inches
karthiccc#0069,That does not mean 5'8
Lucаs#7263,isnt 178 510?

karthiccc#0069,Exactly
BlazeThief#4311,lol
BlazeThief#4311,well my mom sent me it
BlazeThief#4311,so she must have just searched it
Lucаs#7263,so merak u mustve just not been standing up tall and measured a few cm less
BlazeThief#4311,and saw the first thing
BlazeThief#4311,and was like aight this is fact
BlazeThief#4311,Ive been cursed to never reach 6 feet since I went to science north when I was 10
BlazeThief#4311,and they had a thing that would say what your max height was
BlazeThief#4311,and mine said 5'11
BlazeThief#4311,like blev
BlazeThief#4311,they capped my power
Lucаs#7263,i mean
Lucаs#7263,at the end of the day what u gonna do about it
BlazeThief#4311,elongate my bones
Lucаs#7263,other than stilts
Lucаs#7263,oh

BlazeThief#4311,raise them by about 4 feet
BlazeThief#4311,tallest man that ever lived
Lucаs#7263,bruh ur so toxic
BlazeThief#4311,I can split parts of it off as a gift to my brotha karthik

karthiccc#0069,merak at least you are 5'11
karthiccc#0069,your boy here max height is 5'7
BlazeThief#4311,im like 5'10

BlazeThief#4311,I remember there was an xqc clip of him asking a skateboard shop worker what the meta pick was for skateboards
BlazeThief#4311,gotta be like that
BlazeThief#4311,this laptop is the meta
karthiccc#0069,it makes more sense for tech tho
BlazeThief#4311,true
karthiccc#0069,wouldnt be the weirdest thing to say
karthiccc#0069,but saying that to a grandma buying her son a computer
karthiccc#0069,that would be a bit weird
BlazeThief#4311,lmao
BlazeThief#4311,imagine
BlazeThief#4311,yes ma'am this here is the S tier meta pick for laptops
karthiccc#0069,YES
karthiccc#0069,and she would just nod her head in agreement
BlazeThief#4311,have laptops rated by tier
karthiccc#0069,we got the G tier for grandma tier
BlazeThief#4311,d tier would be cheapest but worst
karthiccc#0069,yes
BlazeThief#4311,Grandma and Grandpap
karthiccc#0069,which one is better tho?
karthiccc#0069,grandma or grandpap?
BlazeThief#4311,nah
BlazeThief#4311,the tier is gg
karthiccc#0069,oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh

karthiccc#0069,damn son
BlazeThief#4311,then you play the fortnite rap
karthiccc#0069,no the christian rap
karthiccc#0069,for the Christian youth
BlazeThief#4311,I gotta get a job there and become the owner
BlazeThief#4311,then control the music
karthiccc#0069,im pretty sure the staff can just choose the music too
karthiccc#0069,or something
BlazeThief#4311,damnnnn
karthiccc#0069,its either radio or a set playlist
BlazeThief#4311,play the aphelios song
karthiccc#0069,ooooh god no
karthiccc#0069,not that
karthiccc#0069,lmao
BlazeThief#4311,best song
karthiccc#0069,a true masterpiece
BlazeThief#4311,imagine walking into to staples and all you hear is an ali-a video playing throught the speakers
karthiccc#0069,the speakers are so quiet I dont think people would notice
karthiccc#0069,like the fans are louder
BlazeThief#4311,damnnnnn
karthiccc#0069,play it over the intercom
karthiccc#0069,now thats the play
BlazeThief#4311,play it at the school speakers
BlazeThief#4311,blev
BlazeThief#4311,imagine
BlazeThief#4311,if I was the morning announcer
karthiccc#0069,thats actually possible
BlazeThief#4311,and the intro song I played was the alia intro?
karthiccc#0069,im pretty sure the speaker controls are in mr budrooms room (however you spell his name)
karthiccc#0069,just sneak in there
karthiccc#0069,plug in the aux
karthiccc#0069,and lose control
karthiccc#0069,slip and slide on the dance floor
BlazeThief#4311,honestly
BlazeThief#4311,Would be the S tier meta play
BlazeThief#4311,let me know when that event with ez starts
karthiccc#0069,pretty sure its in like a week or so\
karthiccc#0069,not too sure
BlazeThief#4311,aight
karthiccc#0069,but ye ill notify you my good sir
BlazeThief#4311,might grind for prestige
BlazeThief#4311,else ill never forgive myself if I played again
karthiccc#0069,really?
karthiccc#0069,its not even that good of a skin imo
BlazeThief#4311,better than base
karthiccc#0069,i guess
karthiccc#0069,but still
BlazeThief#4311,they really did him dirty
BlazeThief#4311,why couldnt teemo get this skin
BlazeThief#4311,and he got spirit blossom
BlazeThief#4311,would have been baller
karthiccc#0069,spirit blossom is for ionia tho so it makes sense
BlazeThief#4311,true
karthiccc#0069,how would ez have looked?
BlazeThief#4311,not sure
karthiccc#0069,but spirit blossom prestiege should have been for like yas or ahri or for someone other than bloody teemo
karthiccc#0069,thats just sad
BlazeThief#4311,honestly

BlazeThief#4311,not really
BlazeThief#4311,just know harry doesnt die
J-Klar#4158,i guess
BlazeThief#4311,do we think we should return to the spook game at some point
J-Klar#4158,maybe
J-Klar#4158,im playing star wars a lot tho
J-Klar#4158,u can relate
BlazeThief#4311,yeah I be playing street fighter
J-Klar#4158,more about ffivx
BlazeThief#4311,I stopped my subscription cause I was getting burnt out
BlazeThief#4311,Was playing wayyy too much
J-Klar#4158,F
J-Klar#4158,in chat
BlazeThief#4311,gonna take a break for a few weeks and probably start back up again
BlazeThief#4311,game be fun
BlazeThief#4311,but mmos you do alot of the same crap
BlazeThief#4311,and leveling alt jobs is tedious
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
J-Klar#4158,I like them tho
J-Klar#4158,soooo much content
J-Klar#4158,literally endless
BlazeThief#4311,I wanted to play the jobs for immersion
BlazeThief#4311,but like blev
BlazeThief#4311,it took ages
BlazeThief#4311,like days of doing the same dungeon over and over for like 10 hours
BlazeThief#4311,so summoner for the rest of the time if I play
BlazeThief#4311,get to summon bahamut now aswell
J-Klar#4158,da hell
J-Klar#4158,scuffed
BlazeThief#4311,qwat
J-Klar#4158,eso wasnt like that
BlazeThief#4311,that was just for the most efficient way
BlazeThief#4311,from level 1 to 60
J-Klar#4158,jobs are classes right?
BlazeThief#4311,ye
BlazeThief#4311,the free trial is pogchamp now
BlazeThief#4311,you can go up to the first expansion
J-Klar#4158,"""in swtor each class has two subclasses that can both do different roles (like healer"
J-Klar#4158,which makes levelling good
J-Klar#4158,cuz its different
BlazeThief#4311,yeah ffxiv is like that
J-Klar#4158,and theres like 6 dlc chapters out at this point
BlazeThief#4311,each class becomes another class
BlazeThief#4311,that has storylines that are like like every couple levels
BlazeThief#4311,so you start off as lancer and do lancer quests then become dragoon and do dragoon quests
BlazeThief#4311,each have story
J-Klar#4158,nah
J-Klar#4158,swtor u dont change class
BlazeThief#4311,and they also give more stuff for the actual main story
BlazeThief#4311,lol
BlazeThief#4311,lets you try different stuff
J-Klar#4158,in swtor u'd just make another character foir the other classes
J-Klar#4158,cuz the main story different for all 16
BlazeThief#4311,damn
J-Klar#4158,or technically 8
BlazeThief#4311,that kinda gamer then
BlazeThief#4311,I like having everything on my one lad thou
BlazeThief#4311,feel more connected to you character
J-Klar#4158,i mean it wouldnt make much sense tho
J-Klar#4158,cuz u cant be a jedi guardian and then like a sith assassin
BlazeThief#4311,well yeah that wouldnt make sense
BlazeThief#4311,but in ffxiv it works
J-Klar#4158,idk dude
J-Klar#4158,feels odd that someone could have all the different powers
J-Klar#4158,like they could one sec be a wizard then magically a super tanky dude

J-Klar#4158,you dont even play the game

BlazeThief#4311,it just feels like anything to get excited about is just reused crap
BlazeThief#4311,she seems cool
BlazeThief#4311,but when abunch of recent champs are just reused stuff its not ebic
karthiccc#0069,you right about thast
karthiccc#0069,but this time it is reused stuff but flashier
karthiccc#0069,and that passive is really dumb
BlazeThief#4311,but like yone

karthiccc#0069,like she gets ez ult
BlazeThief#4311,does she?
karthiccc#0069,yes
BlazeThief#4311,I didnt look at the passive too much
BlazeThief#4311,it was the thing from e to s right?
karthiccc#0069,you use ult when you have s
karthiccc#0069,ye

karthiccc#0069,so it would be yas windwall + panth w
Aho#7784,BAN THAT CREATURE
BlazeThief#4311,how does she have ez ult?

karthiccc#0069,she gonna be played everywhere
karthiccc#0069,legit could be
karthiccc#0069,looks more like one too
BlazeThief#4311,just build lethality
karthiccc#0069,someone gonna make a tank build for her and its gonna be broken
BlazeThief#4311,she has built in attack speed like senna
karthiccc#0069,yup
BlazeThief#4311,or was it movement speed
karthiccc#0069,both
BlazeThief#4311,at this point they just going to pump out op lads
karthiccc#0069,she scales
karthiccc#0069,legit
BlazeThief#4311,then all other champs are irrelevant
BlazeThief#4311,they need to make ezreal 2
BlazeThief#4311,just him but busted

karthiccc#0069,give ez urgot machine gun
BlazeThief#4311,his ult is urgots machine gun shooting his ult

J-Klar#4158,Idek what they are called
BlazeThief#4311,Operators right
J-Klar#4158,are yes
J-Klar#4158,that
J-Klar#4158,operators
J-Klar#4158,There is a battle pass now...
BlazeThief#4311,whats the issue with that
J-Klar#4158,just weird
BlazeThief#4311,eh
BlazeThief#4311,Gotta make that money somehow
J-Klar#4158,Yeah through the god damn season pass
J-Klar#4158,shit costs 50 dollars
BlazeThief#4311,But now there a battle pass
J-Klar#4158,There is both
BlazeThief#4311,exactly
BlazeThief#4311,both are in the game
J-Klar#4158,When only the season passs should be
BlazeThief#4311,nah
J-Klar#4158,Yah
BlazeThief#4311,One gives you ops and crap
BlazeThief#4311,other gives you skins and crap
BlazeThief#4311,right?
J-Klar#4158,Ye but Im saying its more stuff to purchase
J-Klar#4158,its just cringe
J-Klar#4158,it never used to have one
Lucаs#7263,I mean I agree with jake only because they treat the character unlocks like league where u unlock them over time yet you still buy the game
J-Klar#4158,Id be fine with the battle pass if you didnt have to buy the characters
J-Klar#4158,cuz the free unlock for them just takes way too long
J-Klar#4158,The season pass was a good answer to that cuz it also gave more benefits
Lucаs#7263,Yeah unlocking characters takes ages
J-Klar#4158,quite a lot more
Lucаs#7263,Literally you would have to grind for 4 straight hours of non stop hostage on house farming just to get an op
Lucаs#7263,Or if u play normally it would take 12+ hours
J-Klar#4158,yup
BlazeThief#4311,I just dont see why you are mad about them having a battle pass
BlazeThief#4311,its just skins and stuff is it not?
BlazeThief#4311,how does that relate to grinding characters?
J-Klar#4158,im not mad
J-Klar#4158,its just another thing to buy
BlazeThief#4311,you dont have to thou
J-Klar#4158,no but it could have been something that was for all players lol
J-Klar#4158,or just season pass players
BlazeThief#4311,What you mean
BlazeThief#4311,like only season pass players get it?
J-Klar#4158,that or the paid version yes
BlazeThief#4311,Nah
J-Klar#4158,yah
BlazeThief#4311,Thats kinda wackmeister
J-Klar#4158,right...
BlazeThief#4311,right...
J-Klar#4158,and just buying the battlepass isnt
J-Klar#4158,got it
BlazeThief#4311,Well its a battlepass
BlazeThief#4311,thats like saying fortnite should give stw owners every battle pass
J-Klar#4158,Not really
BlazeThief#4311,or do you mean like since you bought the season pass thing
J-Klar#4158,Its not the same thing
BlazeThief#4311,that it should include the battle pass
J-Klar#4158,ofc?
J-Klar#4158,wut
BlazeThief#4311,how long do those passes even last for?
BlazeThief#4311,I thought it was ages
J-Klar#4158,A year
BlazeThief#4311,yeah I still think they shouldnt
J-Klar#4158,I mean you dont play the game
BlazeThief#4311,Thou
BlazeThief#4311,how often are battle passes resetting?
J-Klar#4158,Probably each season
BlazeThief#4311,how many season in a year?
J-Klar#4158,4
BlazeThief#4311,hmm
BlazeThief#4311,They definitely
J-Klar#4158,not saying they would
J-Klar#4158,Im saying the should
BlazeThief#4311,Nah
J-Klar#4158,yah
BlazeThief#4311,nah
J-Klar#4158,Spend 40 dollars on cosmetics or 40 dollars on season pass?
J-Klar#4158,Its so dumb existing
BlazeThief#4311,just dont buy it
BlazeThief#4311,ez game ez life
J-Klar#4158,Obviously
J-Klar#4158,But it would have been nice for them to give people who are already paying for access to the stuff in a season for the battlepass for that season
BlazeThief#4311,But you would still be aight for it to be bought separate and not be an exclusive thing
BlazeThief#4311,like if you dont have the pass you can still get it
J-Klar#4158,Why would I not be?
J-Klar#4158,I mean I would prefer it just doesnt exist
BlazeThief#4311,Thought it could be a og skull trooper type beat
J-Klar#4158,they are just dumb
BlazeThief#4311,lol
J-Klar#4158,not really
J-Klar#4158,nobody cares all that much about skins in siege
J-Klar#4158,other than black ice
J-Klar#4158,which has nothing to do with battlepasses
BlazeThief#4311,are the skins even good?
J-Klar#4158,the best ones
J-Klar#4158,in most cases
BlazeThief#4311,in the battle pass
J-Klar#4158,i didnt check
J-Klar#4158,probably not
BlazeThief#4311,lol
J-Klar#4158,siege doesnt really have that great of skins
BlazeThief#4311,I finished my placements
BlazeThief#4311,with a full team of golds
BlazeThief#4311,and a toxic senna
J-Klar#4158,*promos

J-Klar#4158,f
BlazeThief#4311,They had an olaf

BlazeThief#4311,If I can knock the work out super quick

BlazeThief#4311,why wouldnt I
BlazeThief#4311,My family wants me to be getting out of the house more thou
J-Klar#4158,go for a walk
J-Klar#4158,No cap if the xbox one x / ps5 had mouse and keyboard support I would actually consider selling my stuff
J-Klar#4158,but consoles still arent there likes pcs
J-Klar#4158,u cant really play many older games
J-Klar#4158,and some games like mmos wouldn't work all too well (UNLESS THEY ADDED MBK) you cant dual screen it so no yt or twitch no modding no web browsing. like imagine you cant alt tab and search something. that would be so weird
J-Klar#4158,they're just so cost effective
J-Klar#4158,like pcs cost so much more to do what these lil boxes are doing
J-Klar#4158,its cringe
BlazeThief#4311,why would you sell your pc for it
BlazeThief#4311,you couldnt play crap like league anymore
BlazeThief#4311,have to pay to play online
BlazeThief#4311,you would legit be isolated from playing with anyone in this friend group with most games
BlazeThief#4311,simply because you dont have a pc
BlazeThief#4311,Unless they become like actual pc kinda tings
BlazeThief#4311,It wouldnt be gamerchad to switch

karthiccc#0069,no lie kinda baller
Pizzanat#6176,LUCAS MY BROTHER DOES NOT APPROVE OF CHAIR ON CARPET!
J-Klar#4158,Idk chair on carpet is good thing
J-Klar#4158,it wont roll
karthiccc#0069,i second jake
karthiccc#0069,chair on carpet > hard wood
Pizzanat#6176,Just don't be weird and let it roll?
karthiccc#0069,it kinda just moves on its own tho you know?
Pizzanat#6176,It never does that for me
karthiccc#0069,some of us are not tall enough to have their feet on the ground
Pizzanat#6176,So maybe my chair is just too cool
Pizzanat#6176,Hmm maybe
Pizzanat#6176,So only you and jake then
karthiccc#0069,woah there you making assumptions here jasper?
karthiccc#0069,how rude
karthiccc#0069,calling me and jake short
Pizzanat#6176,And merak if he sits weirdly
karthiccc#0069,excuse me no
karthiccc#0069,shut up
karthiccc#0069,take it back
karthiccc#0069,please
karthiccc#0069,:D
karthiccc#0069,i feel better
Pizzanat#6176,Wow you're too tall dude
karthiccc#0069,ok no need to lie
Pizzanat#6176,Wow you're so short dude
karthiccc#0069,ok now you just hurting my feelings
karthiccc#0069,just say nothing
Pizzanat#6176,Wow
karthiccc#0069,or that
karthiccc#0069,im fine with that
Lucаs#7263,o use chair on carpet cuz it makes less noise
Lucаs#7263,when i go rollie pollie
BlazeThief#4311,can confirm
BlazeThief#4311,I sit weird
BlazeThief#4311,but chair doesnt move reallY
J-Klar#4158,Wait you guys don't live on a slope?
karthiccc#0069,I kinda do which is why i got that nice carpet
maximumeffort1#3058,Lucas yo room not too bad
Lucаs#7263,yo can everyone send wifi spped tests so i can compare
Lucаs#7263,just the google one
Pizzanat#6176,except its actually this
Lucаs#7263,uh oh
Pizzanat#6176,what?
Pizzanat#6176,is yours slower than 3 mb/s? :o
Pizzanat#6176,oh no
Pizzanat#6176,thats just over 1 mb/s for downloads
Pizzanat#6176,so have fun
Pizzanat#6176,hmmmmmmmmmmm... should be able to handle steaming an hd video
Pizzanat#6176,nice
Pizzanat#6176,just one
Lucаs#7263,oh no
Pizzanat#6176,is it worse?
Lucаs#7263,estimated 10 minutes for 2.5gb
Pizzanat#6176,yup
Lucаs#7263,that used to be like 1 minute
Pizzanat#6176,but i pretty much do 1 mb/s anyways since i have to forcefully slow it to that otherwise everything else in my house dies
Pizzanat#6176,so we're the same! :D
Lucаs#7263,i mean it probably doesnt help that im also using a usb wifi adapter cuz no ethernet here
Pizzanat#6176,maybe thats another reason
Pizzanat#6176,what happens if you actually connect to ethernet then?
BlazeThief#4311,wifi
BlazeThief#4311,or wired?
Pizzanat#6176,because i'm on ethernet............
Pizzanat#6176,will you be able to try it or will you just have to live on usb wifi now?
BlazeThief#4311,should I use me pc or me phone
Lucаs#7263,yeah jasper i dont think ethernet is an option here
Lucаs#7263,my dad said he might have a pci wifi card which may be faster tho
Pizzanat#6176,that'd be good
BlazeThief#4311,why is ethernet not an option?
Pizzanat#6176,"""and on my phone"
Pizzanat#6176,too far?
Pizzanat#6176,maybe his uncle doesn't want wires going up the walls
BlazeThief#4311,oo
BlazeThief#4311,just move it into your room 500 iq
Pizzanat#6176,what if he isn't allowed to?
Lucаs#7263,ye he dont want wires going around the house
Pizzanat#6176,just be right beside the router ez
Pizzanat#6176,thats what i do
Pizzanat#6176,but i am not in a fun spot in the house because of that
Pizzanat#6176,but oh well
Lucаs#7263,one thing i could try is getting one of those signal boosters that has an ethernet port
karthiccc#0069,thats what jake has
karthiccc#0069,imma buy that too once i get paid
Lucаs#7263,but that would just be similar to wifi tho right?>
Pizzanat#6176,better than a usb one
Lucаs#7263,cuz at the end of the day it just picks up the wifi and puts it into pc
BlazeThief#4311,blev
BlazeThief#4311,karthik your download is faster
BlazeThief#4311,than mine
karthiccc#0069,but my wifi is somehow worse
karthiccc#0069,still takes 10 mins to download 2.5
Pizzanat#6176,thats 8.75 mb/s
karthiccc#0069,gb
BlazeThief#4311,maybe its just my chrome one thou
BlazeThief#4311,my steam and stuff downloads like 50 peak
BlazeThief#4311,but chrome it said like 16
Pizzanat#6176,merak yours is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy faster
Pizzanat#6176,maybe chrome is just bad wow
Pizzanat#6176,mine was accurate though
karthiccc#0069,mines not
Lucаs#7263,yeah jasper on my phone the speed is 21.8
Lucаs#7263,so def a wifi issue
Lucаs#7263,need a better chip
Pizzanat#6176,so your wifi is basically the same as mine then! :D
Pizzanat#6176,hahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i'm not alone anymore
karthiccc#0069,two peas in a pod
Pizzanat#6176,i'm sorry you have to suffer
Pizzanat#6176,but i'm not alone! :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
karthiccc#0069,i suffer almost the same fate as you
Lucаs#7263,karhtik urs is fast just not reliable
karthiccc#0069,i guess
karthiccc#0069,cuts out every hour
Lucаs#7263,like one minute ur zoom then ur 9k ping
karthiccc#0069,my wifi built different
karthiccc#0069,she a lil retarded but gets the job done
Pizzanat#6176,its indian/chinese knockoff wifi
Pizzanat#6176,its decent but unreliable
karthiccc#0069,yeah i would never trust indian or chinese wifi
karthiccc#0069,but i dont trust rogers either
Lucаs#7263,ok i def ask about that wifi card
Lucаs#7263,or maybe if i update driveres
Lucаs#7263,maybe cuz i never isntalled any drivers for it
karthiccc#0069,you shouldnt have to
karthiccc#0069,or it depends on the card
Lucаs#7263,i mean it obviously works with windows think like when u plug ur gpu in it works but for best performance u install drivers
karthiccc#0069,true I guess
J-Klar#4158,Yeah idk the values are scuffed
J-Klar#4158,it takes me like 20 minutes to download 200gb
J-Klar#4158,but the test gave me 11.9mpbs
J-Klar#4158,Yup did a different test and 210Mbps...
BlazeThief#4311,I think google download just scuffed
BlazeThief#4311,it took me 20 minutes to download a 300mb zip at one point
J-Klar#4158,Yeah don't use the google issued one
J-Klar#4158,its just wrong
J-Klar#4158,Yeah it seems they're all scuffed
J-Klar#4158,I get different values on all of them
BlazeThief#4311,wonder if I can make google download stuff faster thou
J-Klar#4158,Thats what I dont get
BlazeThief#4311,like i get 50+mbs peak on steam and epic games
J-Klar#4158,For me downloads everywhere are fine
BlazeThief#4311,and then chrome is like 2
J-Klar#4158,i mean I dont use chrome
J-Klar#4158,cuz chrome is ass
BlazeThief#4311,wonder if firefox downloads quicker
J-Klar#4158,It uses less ram
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
J-Klar#4158,which be pogalicious
BlazeThief#4311,chrome be eating it for breakfast
karthiccc#0069,Yeah jake you right
karthiccc#0069,On my phone its completely different

Aho#7784,@MERAK @karthiccc HORIMIYA JANUARY 2021 ANIME!
BlazeThief#4311,ye
Aho#7784,@MERAK @OSAMA BIN VIBIN HORIMIYA JANUARY 2021 ANIME!
Aho#7784,@MERAK @OSAMA BIN VIBIN HORIMIYA JANUARY 2021 ANIME!
Aho#7784,@MERAK @OSAMA BIN VIBIN HORIMIYA JANUARY 2021 ANIME!
Aho#7784,@MERAK @OSAMA BIN VIBIN HORIMIYA JANUARY 2021 ANIME!
BlazeThief#4311,It got announced a bit ago
Aho#7784,the trailer was released 2 days ago
Aho#7784,I've been missing out
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,they had like a teaser and stuff aswell
Aho#7784,been to busy with SCHOOL!
BlazeThief#4311,I forget how long before
BlazeThief#4311,noice
BlazeThief#4311,No one played
BlazeThief#4311,I played one game
BlazeThief#4311,and hated life
BlazeThief#4311,I have to get this skin
BlazeThief#4311,but the game is just not for me right now
J-Klar#4158,Well I played 5 games
J-Klar#4158,And had fun
BlazeThief#4311,rip amoongus 2
Aho#7784,Atleast I don't have to buy among us 2 now
Aho#7784,they're also making among us 1 basically 2 so it's not that bad
BlazeThief#4311,ye
J-Klar#4158,ye
J-Klar#4158,uh...
J-Klar#4158,@Lucаs
Aho#7784,is this a new runescape game?
J-Klar#4158,No lol
J-Klar#4158,Steam is just acquiring so many mmos recently
J-Klar#4158,its weird
Aho#7784,Ahhh
Lucаs#7263,K distance learning kinda scuffed
Lucаs#7263,I asked about switching and they basically said that u might just not get your courses
Lucаs#7263,Oh and jake that’s rs3 no one likes that
J-Klar#4158,?
J-Klar#4158,I switched
J-Klar#4158,everything fine?
Lucаs#7263,Did you switch for next semester or this one?
J-Klar#4158,well its not official until the next
J-Klar#4158,but they tell u just to contact ur teachers
Lucаs#7263,Wait so u didn’t really switch u just aren’t going in
J-Klar#4158,Yeah you can't switch mid semester
J-Klar#4158,But you can just let your teachers konw u want to work frmo home
Lucаs#7263,I just got off the phone with guidance and they said when you officially switch you technically enroll in a different school like a “virtual school” and they can’t guarantee that you get all your classes because they might be full or just straight up not be offered
J-Klar#4158,That doesn't make any sense though
Lucаs#7263,"""Like even at Jacob"
J-Klar#4158,Because before I even switched my in class teacher was positng the work for full distance learners
J-Klar#4158,and she still is
J-Klar#4158,with direct messages to us
J-Klar#4158,and it still follows the same class schedule
J-Klar#4158,They've done an awful job at being transparent
Lucаs#7263,Yeah jake that’s not true distance tho that’s just choosing not to attend hybrid model
J-Klar#4158,It's really bad
BlazeThief#4311,Thats what my math was doing aswell
BlazeThief#4311,he was posting stuff for the peeps not at school
Lucаs#7263,That’s not true distance
BlazeThief#4311,thou
BlazeThief#4311,wait
BlazeThief#4311,Technically we havent gone in yet
Lucаs#7263,True distance makes you enroll in a different school
BlazeThief#4311,so it may be different thenm
BlazeThief#4311,?
BlazeThief#4311,qwat
Lucаs#7263,Read the messages man
BlazeThief#4311,aight
BlazeThief#4311,aint gonna pull a jordan
J-Klar#4158,was about to say
BlazeThief#4311,how they gonna have a virtual school
BlazeThief#4311,imagine its just like club penguin and you all are just vibing in a class
Lucаs#7263,Nah it’s just like a normal school but with teachers doing only online
BlazeThief#4311,hmm
BlazeThief#4311,seems scuffed either way
BlazeThief#4311,Do you guys even think school will stay open
BlazeThief#4311,or are they just going to close in like a month
Lucаs#7263,Noone knows
BlazeThief#4311,have any other schools in ontario closed or anything
BlazeThief#4311,imma look it up
Lucаs#7263,Wait jake does that mean even for math ur not going in?
J-Klar#4158,No point
J-Klar#4158,really
J-Klar#4158,I mean like you said its not official so if I wanted I could
J-Klar#4158,Lucas how much of cs have you done?
Lucаs#7263,only thing is what happens if u just dont go in w do u do for tests
Lucаs#7263,tahts the only sketch thing
J-Klar#4158,Wut
J-Klar#4158,You have to go in for the tests...
Lucаs#7263,sketchy sketch
Lucаs#7263,cuz if u do legit distance learn u dont go in for tests
Lucаs#7263,because ur not enrolled at jacob
J-Klar#4158,Imma email my guidance councellor and see
J-Klar#4158,Cuz they never mentioned that lol
J-Klar#4158,Oh I see
J-Klar#4158,Yeah hybrid is the play lol
J-Klar#4158,and then just do it from home
J-Klar#4158,they just made it seem that hybrid you had to go in
J-Klar#4158,such a shit communication job
J-Klar#4158,Ye I hadn't switched anyway
J-Klar#4158,was just doing hybrid from home
J-Klar#4158,Yeah wait what is the point in distance learning lmao
J-Klar#4158,And how would you do tests??
karthiccc#0069,U do tests but what my chem teacher said is they are longer and usually a lot harder because they cant guarantee students wont cheat
karthiccc#0069,So like expect a test that is normally out of 60 to be out of 100 or so and to have a lot more full answer questions
Lucаs#7263,"""yeah karthik you also said that distance learning students had to go into school for tests"
J-Klar#4158,I feel that the scaling of that would still be in favour of online tests
J-Klar#4158,by far
J-Klar#4158,doesnt really matter how hard or how many questions
J-Klar#4158,if u can cheat
J-Klar#4158,ez dub
Lucаs#7263,forreal
J-Klar#4158,but
Lucаs#7263,i kinda want to tbh
J-Klar#4158,I doubt thats how its done
J-Klar#4158,there is no way they just let you cheat
J-Klar#4158,you probably have to go to your actual school to do it
J-Klar#4158,like how we did with e learn
Lucаs#7263,well jake they might put time limits on the tests
J-Klar#4158,that isn't a jacob class
J-Klar#4158,but it was our school
J-Klar#4158,so we did it there
J-Klar#4158,eh
Lucаs#7263,and the elearn wasJUST the exam remember all the other quizes too?
karthiccc#0069,ok look i know me sources are pretty shit normally but this the teacher sayin it
karthiccc#0069,i think
karthiccc#0069,my sources aint the best
J-Klar#4158,I guess
J-Klar#4158,the quiz isnt real the same as a unit test
Lucаs#7263,i dont think you ever go into class
Lucаs#7263,cuz ur not enrolled at jacob anymore
J-Klar#4158,Welp Im not doing it if it scuffs it
J-Klar#4158,Sounds sketchy af
Lucаs#7263,so they cant make u go in or anything u technically dont have a class there
J-Klar#4158,I mean you're definitely still registered to your school
Lucаs#7263,ur in the school's system but ur not enrolled there
J-Klar#4158,Other than the ability to cheat there is no reason to do distance
J-Klar#4158,just dont go in with hybrid
Lucаs#7263,exactly thats why
J-Klar#4158,I dont think its worth it
J-Klar#4158,cuz u arent just graded on tests
Lucаs#7263,i def do
J-Klar#4158,what about projects
Lucаs#7263,ezclap them
J-Klar#4158,ye but if ur retarded
Lucаs#7263,u can research them for however long u need
J-Klar#4158,still imagine physics labs. there would of been some we would never have got right
Lucаs#7263,literally all it takes to do online is time to research shit u dont know
J-Klar#4158,Ill just stick to hybrid
J-Klar#4158,distance sketches me
J-Klar#4158,And there is still a chance that you actually have to go into a class
Lucаs#7263,"""well another thing jake is that bausmer hella sketch"

J-Klar#4158,Lmao

J-Klar#4158,You could get bosmer for physics
J-Klar#4158,hes teaching full distance
Lucаs#7263,literally as long as i get a rubric i will get 100%
Lucаs#7263,its literally just a checklist u just check off free marks

karthiccc#0069,like math she fine but i dunno about physics
J-Klar#4158,She studied it at uni
J-Klar#4158,I asked her

karthiccc#0069,i have it next sem
karthiccc#0069,wbu?

karthiccc#0069,i honestly wonder if you can adopt a canadian child and have it work
J-Klar#4158,That sounds scuffed
J-Klar#4158,and probably not how that works lmao
karthiccc#0069,"""If your adopted child is already a permanent resident"
karthiccc#0069,yoooooooo
karthiccc#0069,you can
J-Klar#4158,its probably 80% chance at this point that I go back to the motherland
karthiccc#0069,nah adopt a child jake
karthiccc#0069,adopt me or lucas
karthiccc#0069,then you fine
J-Klar#4158,I wouldn't be able to even if that would be a scuffed strat lmao
J-Klar#4158,too young
J-Klar#4158,Id presume youd have to be 18
J-Klar#4158,more likely 21
karthiccc#0069,pretty sure its 18
karthiccc#0069,so just one more year
karthiccc#0069,of being jobless
J-Klar#4158,Great fucking country
karthiccc#0069,and citizenless
J-Klar#4158,You can have a human child at 18 but not drink
J-Klar#4158,Sound fucking ideals
J-Klar#4158,This place is scuffed
karthiccc#0069,yeah just checked it is 18
J-Klar#4158,Yeah by the time Im 18 ill be gone tho lol
karthiccc#0069,why you leaving tho?
J-Klar#4158,Family are kinda sick of not getting permanent residency
J-Klar#4158,If we get it before I finish I think we're staying
J-Klar#4158,if not
J-Klar#4158,we leave
J-Klar#4158,I mean idrc
karthiccc#0069,shit I see
J-Klar#4158,Im done school
J-Klar#4158,so
karthiccc#0069,would you rather go to school in the motherland?
karthiccc#0069,but you going for post secondary arent ya
J-Klar#4158,im completely indifferent
J-Klar#4158,lets be honest tho english unis are probably better
karthiccc#0069,if you do go back to the motherland you could go to oxford or cambridge or something
karthiccc#0069,i mean they better for certain things
karthiccc#0069,but engineering is better here
karthiccc#0069,"""cuz like ya know """"waterloo"""""""
karthiccc#0069,"""""""toronto"""""""
J-Klar#4158,Yeah I think we all know my stance on that
karthiccc#0069,true
J-Klar#4158,Over hyped cringe
J-Klar#4158,No offence
karthiccc#0069,i guess
karthiccc#0069,no offence taken
J-Klar#4158,good
J-Klar#4158,:)
karthiccc#0069,its just the most broad field
J-Klar#4158,I guess
karthiccc#0069,but like what you gonna go into then?
J-Klar#4158,I dont know yet
J-Klar#4158,There are a couple of things Im interested in
J-Klar#4158,"""Probably one of these: Law"
J-Klar#4158,I can't see what else I would go for
karthiccc#0069,i guess england would be better for writing and law
karthiccc#0069,writing is such a weird field tho
karthiccc#0069,the chances of you getting a good job is so low unless you know people already
karthiccc#0069,that can get you in
J-Klar#4158,"""I've watched the social network Karthik"
karthiccc#0069,great film
karthiccc#0069,loved it
J-Klar#4158,AND GUESS WHAT MADE IT SO GREAT
J-Klar#4158,My boy Martin
J-Klar#4158,A SCRIPT WRITER
karthiccc#0069,yes
karthiccc#0069,but
karthiccc#0069,you gotta get to that position first
karthiccc#0069,and how do you do that?
J-Klar#4158,Hes my uncle
karthiccc#0069,not by writing good scripts cuz have you seen star wars lately?
karthiccc#0069,wait
J-Klar#4158,L O L plz dont remind me of that shit
J-Klar#4158,Already severed from my head cannon
karthiccc#0069,facts it was so absolutely garbage
J-Klar#4158,I find it funny that they made that abomination of shit cannon but then decannonized all of legends
karthiccc#0069,hey man at least they knew they fucked up
karthiccc#0069,but didnt un fuck their fuck up in the end
karthiccc#0069,so in the end they still fucked
J-Klar#4158,I mean JJ Abrams tried. Sure his films weren't that great but they were still better than Ryan Johnson's steaming pile of shit
J-Klar#4158,sUbVeRtInG eXpEcTaTiOnS
karthiccc#0069,yeah i guess
karthiccc#0069,abrams > johnson but like not by too much
karthiccc#0069,they both meh
J-Klar#4158,Yep
karthiccc#0069,Christopher Nolan on the other hand
karthiccc#0069,masterpiece
J-Klar#4158,OwO daddy
J-Klar#4158,"""I mean I love Christopher Nolan"
karthiccc#0069,heard it was bad
karthiccc#0069,was it?
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
karthiccc#0069,or did you not watch it
karthiccc#0069,oh
karthiccc#0069,when did you watch it?
J-Klar#4158,Like last week
karthiccc#0069,bruh
karthiccc#0069,i woulda came with if you said you were gonna watch it
J-Klar#4158,Well I go with my dad to the movies
karthiccc#0069,ah thats fair i guess
karthiccc#0069,but anyway wasnt it over complicated for no reason or something?
J-Klar#4158,Very
J-Klar#4158,Way too hard to follow
karthiccc#0069,ah
karthiccc#0069,so he tried to pull another inception but failed
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
karthiccc#0069,sad man
J-Klar#4158,:(
karthiccc#0069,the trailers made it look so good
karthiccc#0069,i was getting so hyped too
J-Klar#4158,The acting was really good
J-Klar#4158,Same with the visuals
karthiccc#0069,i could imagine
J-Klar#4158,The plot just
karthiccc#0069,just story tho eh
J-Klar#4158,Made
J-Klar#4158,No sense
karthiccc#0069,yeah unfortunate
karthiccc#0069,"""nolan trying so hard to pull the """"im fourteen and this is deep"""" type shit"""
J-Klar#4158,lmao
karthiccc#0069,trying to make himself look smarter or more creative I guess
J-Klar#4158,"""I think he had an idea"
J-Klar#4158,I have a theory though
karthiccc#0069,nah i think he had a simple Idea then he just wanted to make everyone else not get it
J-Klar#4158,If you look at interviews for inception and his other movies he talks about how he views films to be very similar to dreams in the way that a good film makes you not question it and believe it even when it doesn't fit with reality. So the convluded plot of tenet could be displaying that kinda
J-Klar#4158,But it just didn't work
karthiccc#0069,so just too abstract
karthiccc#0069,like at least some dreams make sense
karthiccc#0069,but others you can like know that its just way too over the top
J-Klar#4158,"""No I think he just fell far too much into that narrative and made a film that you would believe if it was a dream and you were asleep"
karthiccc#0069,thats a nice way to put it into perspective
karthiccc#0069,hopefully he realizes that and makes something better
karthiccc#0069,next

Aho#7784,WHat about mics Karthik?
karthiccc#0069,We do price matching too so if you can find it for cheaper somehwere i can get it for less

karthiccc#0069,someboody gotta find the chat of lucas calling anyone who watched anime gay
BlazeThief#4311,mans opinions changed
BlazeThief#4311,gamerchad play

BlazeThief#4311,Carry him out of plat
karthiccc#0069,"""""""hey tops roaming down"
BlazeThief#4311,then he gives you a promotion
karthiccc#0069,legit
BlazeThief#4311,Gets penta
karthiccc#0069,"""boy already has a 5 stack tho"
BlazeThief#4311,danggg
BlazeThief#4311,It be like that
karthiccc#0069,it really do
karthiccc#0069,so many people at my work play league
J-Klar#4158,Does he play ryze? that would fit the trifecta in
karthiccc#0069,legit all the guys do
karthiccc#0069,nah he dont play ryze but he do play kindred for jungle
J-Klar#4158,pog
J-Klar#4158,Good choices
J-Klar#4158,When pre season comes out I would reccomend playing the game is so cool now
J-Klar#4158,more runes and the item building has way more options
J-Klar#4158,its much more engaging
karthiccc#0069,i want to play the game more
karthiccc#0069,i got new mouse too so i want to game
J-Klar#4158,also the new items looks insane
karthiccc#0069,but
J-Klar#4158,so do the updated ones
karthiccc#0069,ya boy working
J-Klar#4158,f
J-Klar#4158,welll
J-Klar#4158,not f
J-Klar#4158,but
J-Klar#4158,f for gaming
karthiccc#0069,but also ya boy will be probably quitin soon
J-Klar#4158,W for thriving
J-Klar#4158,WHAT
J-Klar#4158,why
J-Klar#4158,blev
karthiccc#0069,cuz it gettin hard man
J-Klar#4158,you spent so long applying lmao
karthiccc#0069,i know it is sad
karthiccc#0069,"""but when i think about it"
J-Klar#4158,is school work really that bad
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,pretty bad
J-Klar#4158,for me so far its been a piece of cake
karthiccc#0069,because since everything is going so fast I dont have enough time to study what we take for the day
karthiccc#0069,so i get behind
karthiccc#0069,and I dont get time to catch up because of work
karthiccc#0069,especially for chem
karthiccc#0069,where there is just so much to know
J-Klar#4158,True
karthiccc#0069,math was doable
karthiccc#0069,but chem is a nightmare
J-Klar#4158,When you're in class I would presume its alright tho no?
karthiccc#0069,nah not at all
karthiccc#0069,online is much nicer
J-Klar#4158,but you would get so long in class to do the work
karthiccc#0069,not at all
karthiccc#0069,you get like 15 mins in class to do the work
J-Klar#4158,Lol wut
karthiccc#0069,online i can skipp through the lessons that are 40 mins long and take the notes quickly basically in under 15 mins
karthiccc#0069,then do the homework by looking at the notes
karthiccc#0069,and studying at the same time
karthiccc#0069,so i can get everything done
karthiccc#0069,but since during class she goes slower and answers questions I dont got time to do homework
karthiccc#0069,because I dont know everything
karthiccc#0069,then I get back home and its already time to go to work
J-Klar#4158,true thats why I did learning from home for personal life managment I can just read all the slides / watch the videos and then do the work and finish in like 2 hours max
J-Klar#4158,I have to go in for the next week for math for the first time tho
karthiccc#0069,exactly its so nice
J-Klar#4158,got that test on friday :(
J-Klar#4158,v scared
karthiccc#0069,nah you'll be fine
karthiccc#0069,it aint bad at all
karthiccc#0069,polynomials right?
J-Klar#4158,Nah
karthiccc#0069,exponents?
J-Klar#4158,logarithims and exponents
karthiccc#0069,ah
karthiccc#0069,easy stuff mate
karthiccc#0069,you'll be fine
karthiccc#0069,your jake
J-Klar#4158,True dat
karthiccc#0069,the ginger with brains
J-Klar#4158,its pretty much all the same stuff
karthiccc#0069,legit
karthiccc#0069,not hard
J-Klar#4158,just written differently
J-Klar#4158,lmao
J-Klar#4158,not that i think its hard I just dont like tests man
karthiccc#0069,i get to start that tomorrow
karthiccc#0069,yeah i feel you
J-Klar#4158,its really easier
karthiccc#0069,the pressure sucks
J-Klar#4158,he gives so many hw questions tho
karthiccc#0069,you keep doubting yourself too
karthiccc#0069,a lot of hw is nice
J-Klar#4158,but he just asks for you to submit a couple of them
karthiccc#0069,ye thats good
J-Klar#4158,"""well its nice"
J-Klar#4158,Which the start was
J-Klar#4158,then its just rational exponents
karthiccc#0069,just a little tedious right
karthiccc#0069,nothing hard
J-Klar#4158,nah
J-Klar#4158,and there are just like 3 different types of logarithm word problems that all have set formulas and its literally plug and go then just exponent word problems that are just what we did last time
J-Klar#4158,"""growth"
J-Klar#4158,anyway bed time
J-Klar#4158,gn
karthiccc#0069,Ight yeah gn bb
karthiccc#0069,Ya boy gonna go finish his chem lab now too

karthiccc#0069,The king has returned!!!
J-Klar#4158,Wtf Steve in smash steve lmao
J-Klar#4158,Karthik you've done the polynomial test thing right
J-Klar#4158,Was there a question where you would actually have to know how go do long division (divisor is more than one degree) or nah can u just rub synthetic division all over that test
Pizzanat#6176,wow you didn't ask the teacher that? he would've said that there will not be a question where you have to use long division
J-Klar#4158,Roger dodger
J-Klar#4158,Sounds gamer
J-Klar#4158,Boys I shaved but I left the stache do I grow it out
J-Klar#4158,Or do I end its career
Pizzanat#6176,grow a mustache with curls at the end pls
J-Klar#4158,Will do will be a real gentlemen
J-Klar#4158,It looks like it might be a handle bar tho
J-Klar#4158,Kinda tilting down
Pizzanat#6176,Hmmmmmmmmmm
karthiccc#0069,Yeah there were a couple questions with long division
Pizzanat#6176,Would look interesting too
J-Klar#4158,Wut
Pizzanat#6176,AND WHAT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY
J-Klar#4158,BRUH
karthiccc#0069,Really?
karthiccc#0069,I had at least 3
J-Klar#4158,I'll just ask him tmrw lol
J-Klar#4158,Cuz synthetic is much easier to remember
karthiccc#0069,Because you can do synthetic where the divisor is a polynomial
karthiccc#0069,*cant
Pizzanat#6176,Mr.Ritchie literally said to our class that there won't be anything with long division ever
Pizzanat#6176,Yeah
karthiccc#0069,Bruh
J-Klar#4158,... yes u can karthik
Pizzanat#6176,And we only had to divide by binomials
J-Klar#4158,It just can't be 2nd degree
karthiccc#0069,Wait oh ya no exponents
J-Klar#4158,Ye
karthiccc#0069,Yeah nvm but still there was a question like that with exponents as the divisor
J-Klar#4158,Bruh
karthiccc#0069,Its was a trinomial with x^2
J-Klar#4158,I'll just see what he says
J-Klar#4158,Cringe
J-Klar#4158,Long division creeps me out
J-Klar#4158,karthik what are your thoughts on the stache
J-Klar#4158,What direction do we go
karthiccc#0069,I wanna see you like this:
karthiccc#0069,But ginger

karthiccc#0069,no idea what any of that means but sure
BlazeThief#4311,Venti and noelle are characters
BlazeThief#4311,you get the lads by going into the wish store

J-Klar#4158,Racist

maximumeffort1#3058,Bruh i think this server has devolved to only league
Lucаs#7263,I mean there’s only like 3 active users and they all play league
Lucаs#7263,If anyone wants to play something different I’m always down for almost anything else but no one does
karthiccc#0069,he got a point kyle
Pizzanat#6176,its also a place for all of us to reach all of us if we need to so that all of us can know what one of all of us wants to say to all of us
BlazeThief#4311,couldnt have said it better myself jasper
maximumeffort1#3058,I mean
maximumeffort1#3058,Is there really any game we all play together anymore?
maximumeffort1#3058,Besides league
maximumeffort1#3058,Cuz playin with someone is better than playin alone
karthiccc#0069,Well if you have something in mind that all of us could play then we're open for suggestions
BlazeThief#4311,HR is open if you have any requests
J-Klar#4158,Lmao

karthiccc#0069,or cambridge
J-Klar#4158,Lmao Bristol. I could apply for oxford though but its too expensive
J-Klar#4158,and not going to be close to home
J-Klar#4158,Cambridge would be harder but defeinitely possible
J-Klar#4158,But again expensive and not close to where we would live
karthiccc#0069,lmao imagine leaving us for britain
karthiccc#0069,hahahahahaha

karthiccc#0069,ok
J-Klar#4158,POG
J-Klar#4158,Cheat sheets r us
J-Klar#4158,POG
karthiccc#0069,big pog I know
karthiccc#0069,i love it
karthiccc#0069,easy 99% average here I come
J-Klar#4158,What do you have rn
karthiccc#0069,97
J-Klar#4158,97 gang rise up
J-Klar#4158,@karthiccc Gaming?
karthiccc#0069,eyy les go jakey
karthiccc#0069,also nah me doing chem
J-Klar#4158,Roger
J-Klar#4158,What do you have in that?
karthiccc#0069,uuuuuh no comment
J-Klar#4158,DAMN is it really that bad?
karthiccc#0069,i mean more than 80 but still
karthiccc#0069,not great
J-Klar#4158,Oof do you think it will matter?
karthiccc#0069,hopefully not
karthiccc#0069,i mean cs doesnt need a chem mark
karthiccc#0069,so we will have to see how it goes
J-Klar#4158,"""Mmm In england everything is based off your A levels"
karthiccc#0069,A levels?
J-Klar#4158,For example for Oxford or Bristol I would need an A* in Math and doubles A in something else
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
karthiccc#0069,so they only look at your top 3 courses then
J-Klar#4158,Im guessing
karthiccc#0069,hmmmm
karthiccc#0069,seems much nicer
J-Klar#4158,but for certain courses they will look at certain things
karthiccc#0069,yeah like mandatory courses for the program right?
J-Klar#4158,Like for CS like I said A* but then just two A
J-Klar#4158,Ye
karthiccc#0069,aaah gotcha
karthiccc#0069,so it does vary
karthiccc#0069,what it like for law then?
karthiccc#0069,cuz aint that something you lookin into
J-Klar#4158,I decided on comp sci
karthiccc#0069,oh damn
karthiccc#0069,ight I see you
karthiccc#0069,cs gang
J-Klar#4158,but ill check for shits and giggles
karthiccc#0069,ey why not
J-Klar#4158,You would need two A* and a B or A* AA in anything
J-Klar#4158,which is cool
J-Klar#4158,Different options
J-Klar#4158,So yeah I guess they will take my top 3 marks unless it has a specific
J-Klar#4158,But an A* is like a 90 Im pretty sure
J-Klar#4158,and an A is like 85
J-Klar#4158,So not that hard
karthiccc#0069,damn that must be nice
karthiccc#0069,but there has to be a reason why oxford so hard to get into so i dont think just a 90 will do
karthiccc#0069,i mean like just in waterloo for cs it says low 90's is what you need but people with 98's can barely get in
J-Klar#4158,Well its probably enough for interview
karthiccc#0069,i guess
karthiccc#0069,dont you have to write an application essay or something too?
J-Klar#4158,Usually
J-Klar#4158,About your life and stuff
karthiccc#0069,yeah that would be a big determining factor too i guess
J-Klar#4158,I mean Cambridge has like a test you have to do in addition to two A* and an A
karthiccc#0069,gotta be good at the bullshitting
karthiccc#0069,just cambridge things you know
karthiccc#0069,more tests
J-Klar#4158,But hol up while I dab on you with Bristol being a higher ranked school than Waterloo
J-Klar#4158,<o/
karthiccc#0069,for what tho?
J-Klar#4158,It's just in general
karthiccc#0069,a lot of schools out rank waterloo
karthiccc#0069,oh yeah thats very true
karthiccc#0069,waterloo aint regarded that great for anything other than cs and engineering
karthiccc#0069,and even in engineering its primarily computer engineering
J-Klar#4158,True
karthiccc#0069,waterloo do be kinda shitty with everything else
J-Klar#4158,Doesn't it have a good architecture program
karthiccc#0069,meh
karthiccc#0069,not as good as toronto
karthiccc#0069,nothing note worthy
J-Klar#4158,Fucking Domics went to Waterloo
karthiccc#0069,nah he went to tornto
J-Klar#4158,I could've sworn
karthiccc#0069,it toronto
karthiccc#0069,cuz waterloo architecture aint that popular
J-Klar#4158,Damn
karthiccc#0069,ye just think of waterloo as computer school and just that
J-Klar#4158,I was gonna apply to cambridge and oxford for the shits and giggles cuz it honestly doesn't look all that hard to get into especially considering my quadmester average is like 98 right now
karthiccc#0069,then do it
karthiccc#0069,do you fall under the international bracket or national?
J-Klar#4158,It would local I would presume because I would be living in the UK
J-Klar#4158,my grades would be the only international thing
karthiccc#0069,exactly thats why im wondering how it would work
karthiccc#0069,cuz you aint a canadian citizen so you wouldnt count as an international student
karthiccc#0069,but
karthiccc#0069,you studied here and your marks are international
J-Klar#4158,They just convert
karthiccc#0069,that would make sense I guess
J-Klar#4158,Considering A levels are just based off percentages
J-Klar#4158,A levels are literally our grade 12 courses btw high school ends in grade 11
J-Klar#4158,Where you do GCSEs
karthiccc#0069,true but i dont think they will just convert a canadian 98% to a british 98%
J-Klar#4158,Then you can either go to college or 6th form for them
karthiccc#0069,what GCSE?
J-Klar#4158,Pretty much Grade 11 A levels
J-Klar#4158,I think they determine what you would have been able to take
J-Klar#4158,for A levels
karthiccc#0069,ah
karthiccc#0069,you should try emailing one of the schools and see what they do
J-Klar#4158,Waiting to hear back from Bristol
J-Klar#4158,They have a lot of inquires rn because of covid and all
karthiccc#0069,yeah I wouldnt be surprised
karthiccc#0069,whats bristol known for?
J-Klar#4158,I don't really know what it's known for subject wise
J-Klar#4158,Apparently most of their lecturers are indurstry leaders though
karthiccc#0069,did they say that themselves?
karthiccc#0069,cuz wouldnt oxford and cambridge be more likely for that
J-Klar#4158,"""I don't really know"
karthiccc#0069,oh yeah im reading about that too
karthiccc#0069,they got a good research facility
J-Klar#4158,I just have to decide whether to do the three year or 4 year degree
karthiccc#0069,whats the difference?
karthiccc#0069,"""also I was gonna ask"
J-Klar#4158,Ofc
J-Klar#4158,Especially if you're a citizen
karthiccc#0069,oooh yeah true
J-Klar#4158,Not really sure they can just lock you out lmao
karthiccc#0069,fair point
J-Klar#4158,The 4 year would be a master level and the 3 a bachelor I think I dont know its confusing
karthiccc#0069,at least you dont have to do 5 years
karthiccc#0069,and is there coop or like internships too?
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
J-Klar#4158,You get to work for clients
J-Klar#4158,And 'industry leaders'
karthiccc#0069,ooooh spicy stuff
J-Klar#4158,the 4 year gets you a bachelor + degree it seems
karthiccc#0069,do that
J-Klar#4158,like an inbetween of bachelor and master
J-Klar#4158,Im planning on it
karthiccc#0069,much better
karthiccc#0069,maybe I should go to the uk
karthiccc#0069,or try applying
karthiccc#0069,cuz cambridge seems sickly
J-Klar#4158,It's already very expensive let alone for internation students
karthiccc#0069,yup nvm
karthiccc#0069,33 000 pounds per year?
karthiccc#0069,no thank you
J-Klar#4158,"""Yeah... honestly I would probably go for it because its definitely possible to get into for me"
J-Klar#4158,and Im defintely not fucking isaac newton and going to get a scholorship to fucking cambridge
karthiccc#0069,apply and see honestly
karthiccc#0069,try for scholarships too my G
karthiccc#0069,you can!
J-Klar#4158,Bitch thats like trying to get a scholorship for harvard
karthiccc#0069,never know unless you try
karthiccc#0069,maybe they have a soft spot for gingers
J-Klar#4158,Deep
karthiccc#0069,im 14 and dis do be deep
J-Klar#4158,"""Yeah that would be 33k pounds without considering living expenses"
J-Klar#4158,Jesus
J-Klar#4158,who has that money
J-Klar#4158,the average living expenses and expenses for school stuff was an extra 11k
J-Klar#4158,"""A tidy 74"
J-Klar#4158,296k odd dollars
J-Klar#4158,OVER A QUATER MILLION
karthiccc#0069,hey man thats how they make shit tons of money
karthiccc#0069,uni's are all buisnesses
karthiccc#0069,its crazy
J-Klar#4158,Fucking scam
karthiccc#0069,should just go to germany man
karthiccc#0069,free university
J-Klar#4158,I mean name one german uni
karthiccc#0069,the university of berlin
J-Klar#4158,ok I didnt consider that

karthiccc#0069,honestly switzerland is also free schooling
J-Klar#4158,"""Als Volluniversität bietet die Freie Universität an zwölf Fachbereichen und drei Zentralinstituten mehr als 150 Studiengänge in einem breiten Fächerspektrum. Wesentliche Merkmale der Forschungsleistung der Freien Universität sind die Vielfalt weltweiter wissenschaftlicher Kooperationen in Verbundprojekten und Netzwerken mit anderen Akteuren der Forschung"
karthiccc#0069,ja

karthiccc#0069,we share pretzels you and I
karthiccc#0069,if you ever work in germany tho you'd be working for car manufacturers most of the time
J-Klar#4158,Damn its been so long that I struggle to conceptualize sterling anymore and actually have to convert it
J-Klar#4158,15703 dollars
J-Klar#4158,kinda high

karthiccc#0069,cs?
J-Klar#4158,ye
J-Klar#4158,4 years
karthiccc#0069,5k more than waterloo
J-Klar#4158,At least it aint Jordan level
karthiccc#0069,what you mean?
J-Klar#4158,his was expensive as hell or something
J-Klar#4158,Nearly 20k
karthiccc#0069,wtf \
karthiccc#0069,where did he see that?
J-Klar#4158,Ikd
karthiccc#0069,wait he going into electrical engineering
karthiccc#0069,nvm maybe that could be true
karthiccc#0069,was the 15k for bristol jake?
J-Klar#4158,yes
karthiccc#0069,and how close is bristol to where you would be vibin?
J-Klar#4158,Its apparently gonna be real close

J-Klar#4158,If I didn't I would have to wait a year to start uni anway

J-Klar#4158,No
karthiccc#0069,no?
J-Klar#4158,Idk
karthiccc#0069,they would have to look at citizenship for that
J-Klar#4158,Thats what I mean
karthiccc#0069,hmmmmm
J-Klar#4158,We don't have the money for me to apply as an internation
J-Klar#4158,al
karthiccc#0069,"""if you do go tho"
karthiccc#0069,wait no
J-Klar#4158,Probably wouldn't feel any different
karthiccc#0069,lmao tru
karthiccc#0069,but actually you would
karthiccc#0069,because you are in NA

BlazeThief#4311,what in the world

Lucаs#7263,Most of that originally cost money merak so I get them taking it out but the base game raid didn’t which is kinda wack and all the ritual quests were free too
Lucаs#7263,It cost money at one point but then it was made free when the game was free to play

J-Klar#4158,During 12:35 - 1:50
karthiccc#0069,oh
BlazeThief#4311,like she expects you not to work in that time?
J-Klar#4158,Cuz school still on
BlazeThief#4311,Just tell her to die
karthiccc#0069,lmao
J-Klar#4158,Well not her but the school
karthiccc#0069,merak moment
BlazeThief#4311,What is she going to do then
BlazeThief#4311,nothing
BlazeThief#4311,just dies
karthiccc#0069,beat you
karthiccc#0069,to death
BlazeThief#4311,Damn
BlazeThief#4311,if thats what you want
J-Klar#4158,Well she might assign timed tests
J-Klar#4158,During that time
karthiccc#0069,oh thats fucked
J-Klar#4158,Yup
BlazeThief#4311,Exactly
BlazeThief#4311,tell her to perish in an inferno blast
BlazeThief#4311,I don't get timed tests online
BlazeThief#4311,like in comp sci you get timed testes but its like in the next two days start the test
BlazeThief#4311,and when you start it you have 2 hours to complete it
Lucаs#7263,damn i wish my testes were timed
BlazeThief#4311,it is
BlazeThief#4311,2 minutes
BlazeThief#4311,When you lads thinking you will play
karthiccc#0069,after school
BlazeThief#4311,I have a funky google meets ting at like 1 to 1:30
BlazeThief#4311,then I should be done
BlazeThief#4311,when is schoolage done for you?
karthiccc#0069,well depeneds
karthiccc#0069,im gonna finish the notes soon it think
karthiccc#0069,but then we got the assignment to do after 12:30
karthiccc#0069,so we will have to see
BlazeThief#4311,aight
karthiccc#0069,bruh i just am realizing how blind I am.... im legit just sitting at my desk and I cant read the chat on discord without glasses
karthiccc#0069,how did I get to this
Lucаs#7263,too much gaming
karthiccc#0069,small price to pay for gaming
Lucаs#7263,first your ears now your eyes next up is your sense of smell
karthiccc#0069,just get covid for that
BlazeThief#4311,Soon enough your body wont be able to feel anything and you wont notice pain
Lucаs#7263,that is karthiks quirk
BlazeThief#4311,you even watch any of the show yet?
Lucаs#7263,no
Lucаs#7263,i kinda despise how this teacher is explaining stuff
karthiccc#0069,i havent watched any of the videos yet
karthiccc#0069,how bad is it?
Lucаs#7263,when substituting for the formulas she doesnt even write Vave or the delta symbol like she just straight up wrote
Lucаs#7263,V=d/t
Lucаs#7263,no delta no Vave
karthiccc#0069,she probably not gonna care too much about those then
karthiccc#0069,i mean bausmer was really strict about those remember
karthiccc#0069,you would lose marks for it even
Lucаs#7263,well yeah it makes sense
karthiccc#0069,think she wont gaf if we forget
Lucаs#7263,thay are different values
karthiccc#0069,she doesnt put units in equations either
karthiccc#0069,we can legit just treat this as math and not care too much
Lucаs#7263,"""also when explaining relative velocity she pretty much just said """"pick a velocity that matches the displacement"""""""
karthiccc#0069,bruh what
Lucаs#7263,she said pick a velocity that matches the vector direction of the displacement which i sorta get but its just dumb
karthiccc#0069,kinda makes sense i guess
Lucаs#7263,she got me sketched I just want bausmer
karthiccc#0069,we all want bausmer ok maybe not jake but everyone else yeah
karthiccc#0069,if you take it online you get bausmer
karthiccc#0069,but dont know if you wanna switch
Lucаs#7263,u cant now
karthiccc#0069,true
karthiccc#0069,nvm then
Lucаs#7263,and she got some wack ass cosine law
karthiccc#0069,how?
karthiccc#0069,i saw the vid
karthiccc#0069,cosine law the same
Lucаs#7263,eh she use the variables in a different order its not that wack but its still wack
Lucаs#7263,k where htis assingment at
karthiccc#0069,not sure
karthiccc#0069,ion see it either
Lucаs#7263,1235
J-Klar#4158,How is it wack lmao
J-Klar#4158,Also its literally a good thing she doesn't care about that crap
J-Klar#4158,Unlike nazi ass bausmer
J-Klar#4158,Lil cringe head
Lucаs#7263,I liked how bausmer did it
BlazeThief#4311,mans is a nazi??????
Lucаs#7263,nah jake just didnt like him
BlazeThief#4311,damn
BlazeThief#4311,thats alot of accusations you throwing out there
Lucаs#7263,also where my assingments at
BlazeThief#4311,I took them
J-Klar#4158,Chillax she's posting them soon
J-Klar#4158,Like our class just ended
J-Klar#4158,Also she said she was gonna reconsider posting them earlier which is pog
Lucаs#7263,I mean shes telling me that I gotta be here from 8-1:50 and that she posts them at 12:35 so if shes gonna be all peticular I am
Lucаs#7263,im literally sitting here doing nothing
J-Klar#4158,Lul
J-Klar#4158,True
J-Klar#4158,Also the numbers are based off your last r digits of student number

BlazeThief#4311,and probably a leaked version
karthiccc#0069,e is pyke stun kinda
karthiccc#0069,q is legit just jarvan q
BlazeThief#4311,its kinda like taric and pyke combined
karthiccc#0069,and w is something
karthiccc#0069,so is she a top laner?
karthiccc#0069,jg?
BlazeThief#4311,supp
karthiccc#0069,.....
karthiccc#0069,actually?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
karthiccc#0069,everything just screams jg or top tho
BlazeThief#4311,they said they were releasing a mage then a supp
karthiccc#0069,the tankyness
karthiccc#0069,the team play
karthiccc#0069,scuffed
BlazeThief#4311,she breaks shields with one of her abilities
BlazeThief#4311,so it will counter alot of supps
karthiccc#0069,the armour reducing would counter a ton of tanks in top lane too
karthiccc#0069,but i guess her slow attackspeed kinda makes her not fit for it
BlazeThief#4311,yeah I can see her being played everywhere else like sett
karthiccc#0069,lmao exactly
karthiccc#0069,sett 2.0
karthiccc#0069,without the chadness
BlazeThief#4311,have to see how the attack speed comes into play
karthiccc#0069,could be interesting
BlazeThief#4311,yeye
karthiccc#0069,the ult looks kinda underwhelming
karthiccc#0069,esecially if the enemies can still cast abilities
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,though it gets the whole team grouped in one spot
BlazeThief#4311,so you can set up some gamer stuff if you time it right
karthiccc#0069,true ture
karthiccc#0069,imagine a malph yas and this thing on a team
karthiccc#0069,group em up
karthiccc#0069,malph ult
karthiccc#0069,yas ult
karthiccc#0069,or diana ult
karthiccc#0069,or fiddle
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
karthiccc#0069,this could be aids
karthiccc#0069,maybe
BlazeThief#4311,legit
karthiccc#0069,but what new champ isnt
BlazeThief#4311,just group them into perma cc
karthiccc#0069,disgusting
BlazeThief#4311,while she pulls them in they are stunned I think
BlazeThief#4311,looks like they may get knocked up aswell
BlazeThief#4311,not sure thou
karthiccc#0069,it says it doesnt disrupt abilities so it cant be cc
BlazeThief#4311,I think that just means after
karthiccc#0069,oh
karthiccc#0069,i guess maybe
BlazeThief#4311,may be wrong thou
karthiccc#0069,we'll have to wait and see
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,Wonder if shes going to be part of the whole blade thing we saw teased for skins
karthiccc#0069,the lancer wasnt there
karthiccc#0069,so maybe not
karthiccc#0069,unless they change it for her in the skinline
BlazeThief#4311,yeah im not sure
BlazeThief#4311,doesn't really seem like she would fit in it
BlazeThief#4311,but that seems to be the one coming out soom
BlazeThief#4311,unless they just give her a cosmic skin
karthiccc#0069,cosmis could be cool
karthiccc#0069,a cosmic robotic horse sounds sick
BlazeThief#4311,the horse already looks pretty sick
karthiccc#0069,oh and you were right the first part of her ult is cc
BlazeThief#4311,cosmic would just game it even more
BlazeThief#4311,ohh alright
BlazeThief#4311,is it knockup or just stun?
karthiccc#0069,in game it looks like shit
karthiccc#0069,knockup
BlazeThief#4311,is she on pbe?
karthiccc#0069,not too sure
karthiccc#0069,havent checked
BlazeThief#4311,where did you see it?
karthiccc#0069,just on the video
BlazeThief#4311,ohhh
karthiccc#0069,it has got to be a knockup
BlazeThief#4311,yas rell bot lane
karthiccc#0069,ew
karthiccc#0069,imma see if she on pbe
BlazeThief#4311,aight
karthiccc#0069,ok so yeah she aint on pbe
Lucаs#7263,Aoe alarmed
Lucаs#7263,Skarner
karthiccc#0069,yup
BlazeThief#4311,they really play the lads with those weapons
BlazeThief#4311,rell getting a skin in this one
karthiccc#0069,oh their blades upgrade with kills
BlazeThief#4311,Might only be kats not fully sure
"""Her main feature is as follow: every three takedowns"," she unlocks a new blade and equips it."""
BlazeThief#4311,I think kat is the legendary
karthiccc#0069,oh that would make sense then
BlazeThief#4311,every 3 kills she gets a new weapon
karthiccc#0069,"""aint gonna lie tho"
BlazeThief#4311,and when shes out of combat she can switch between them
BlazeThief#4311,they all have different effects
karthiccc#0069,i dont like the qiyana one
karthiccc#0069,kat is pretty nice
karthiccc#0069,diana is meh
BlazeThief#4311,qiyana kinda wack looking
karthiccc#0069,exactly
BlazeThief#4311,the hair is kinda weird to me
karthiccc#0069,what is she from the 1800's
BlazeThief#4311,looks like 2 ice cream cones
karthiccc#0069,lmao fax
BlazeThief#4311,the rell skin is kinda weird aswell
BlazeThief#4311,it doesn't really change much from the splash
karthiccc#0069,the horse looks sick
BlazeThief#4311,it looks cool but not too different from what I remember
karthiccc#0069,the girl just looks like taliah but older
BlazeThief#4311,might have to check again
BlazeThief#4311,I saw someone say her hair was like dunkmaster ivern
karthiccc#0069,bro it actually is
BlazeThief#4311,The kat one is baller since its her first legendary and how much it changes
BlazeThief#4311,but the others aren't insane in the membrane
BlazeThief#4311,We wait for the chance of new kayn and jhin skins
karthiccc#0069,we pray for the chance
karthiccc#0069,and I deeply pray for a new graggy skin
karthiccc#0069,but not gonna happen
BlazeThief#4311,Ohhhhh
karthiccc#0069,until maybe april
BlazeThief#4311,he needs one
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
karthiccc#0069,honestly does
BlazeThief#4311,k/da graggy
karthiccc#0069,but he an under played champ
BlazeThief#4311,ballin
karthiccc#0069,so he gonna have to wait a ton
BlazeThief#4311,Kayn and jhin both broken
BlazeThief#4311,so they bound to get a skin
karthiccc#0069,exactly!
karthiccc#0069,most played jg and adc
BlazeThief#4311,are they?
karthiccc#0069,well jhin is for adc
karthiccc#0069,i assume kayn is for jg
karthiccc#0069,ok well not #1
karthiccc#0069,but kayn is second most
BlazeThief#4311,yeah graves is
BlazeThief#4311,but second is still a pretty large percent
karthiccc#0069,ye exactly
BlazeThief#4311,kha zix man is third lol
karthiccc#0069,but jhin is a whole 200k games above the second place
BlazeThief#4311,yeah holy heck
BlazeThief#4311,makes sense thou
karthiccc#0069,they def gonna nerf him
BlazeThief#4311,mans probably super fun to play with the delete
karthiccc#0069,he really is
karthiccc#0069,so much more unique than all the other adc's
BlazeThief#4311,lol
BlazeThief#4311,soon you'll be able to ult super easy with rells
karthiccc#0069,oh true
karthiccc#0069,she def gonna be disgusting
karthiccc#0069,a naut 2.0 with that tankiness
BlazeThief#4311,exactly
BlazeThief#4311,and the fact she can break others shields is kinda gamer
karthiccc#0069,exactly
karthiccc#0069,"""reduce their armour"
karthiccc#0069,big dead
BlazeThief#4311,imagine shen ult
BlazeThief#4311,then you just like no
karthiccc#0069,lmao trueee
karthiccc#0069,shen counter confirmed
J-Klar#4158,aight but league?
Lucаs#7263,Na
karthiccc#0069,hxh too good
karthiccc#0069,actually @J-Klar ill play now
BlazeThief#4311,Jungle diff
BlazeThief#4311,Imma stop
karthiccc#0069,not really a jg diff
karthiccc#0069,"""more of a top mid"
J-Klar#4158,It was a good week or two
BlazeThief#4311,could have done more
karthiccc#0069,you did fine

BlazeThief#4311,there also gonna be elderwood xayah and rakan
J-Klar#4158,@karthiccc How do you set up the fnet equations?
karthiccc#0069,for?
J-Klar#4158,well I thibnk jsut the stoppers
J-Klar#4158,Im not really sure
J-Klar#4158,tho
J-Klar#4158,what im doing
karthiccc#0069,for the analysis or discussion part?
karthiccc#0069,because the analysis part is scuffed
J-Klar#4158,analysis
karthiccc#0069,oh
J-Klar#4158,yeah
J-Klar#4158,its weird
karthiccc#0069,yeah no one knows
J-Klar#4158,o
karthiccc#0069,neither did the teacher
J-Klar#4158,ah
karthiccc#0069,we had so much trouble understanding
J-Klar#4158,So do I skip?
karthiccc#0069,because you dont ever get a constant
karthiccc#0069,everyone did
J-Klar#4158,Lmao opk
J-Klar#4158,i was sititng here
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat did you end up figuring out 2 on the analysis?
J-Klar#4158,just had no clue
karthiccc#0069,ye no one did
Pizzanat#6176,no
karthiccc#0069,just skip the whole analysis tbf
J-Klar#4158,Ok
karthiccc#0069,because questions 3 and 4 rely on question 2
J-Klar#4158,Ye
Pizzanat#6176,i think i might know how you're supposed to do it but i'm too lazy
Aho#7784,Is there a force applied Karthik?
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
Pizzanat#6176,and there should not be a force applied
karthiccc#0069,no there isnt
J-Klar#4158,On what?
karthiccc#0069,there just isnt a force applied
karthiccc#0069,the only force should be tnesion
karthiccc#0069,tension
karthiccc#0069,so f net = tension
Aho#7784,yeah that's what I thought
Pizzanat#6176,when you consider the fbd for these things they have no force applied since you imagine they are already moving
J-Klar#4158,are you sure about that buddy
karthiccc#0069,yeah forgot about that
J-Klar#4158,lmao
karthiccc#0069,i need to get rid of that
J-Klar#4158,so is it just tension
J-Klar#4158,pulling it
Aho#7784,and no Force of Gravity on the ball either
karthiccc#0069,that too
J-Klar#4158,wut
J-Klar#4158,but its in the air
J-Klar#4158,is it not
karthiccc#0069,we dont take into fact for gravity\
J-Klar#4158,well yeah
karthiccc#0069,because we are calculating fnet in the x
J-Klar#4158,I know
J-Klar#4158,But surely you still should include it
J-Klar#4158,for the diagram
karthiccc#0069,i guess
Aho#7784,she didn't in her example
Aho#7784,so I don't think so
J-Klar#4158,well im keeping it
J-Klar#4158,still exists
Aho#7784,okok
J-Klar#4158,"""Aight so I just skp 2"
karthiccc#0069,ye
J-Klar#4158,ah i c why you can do it in a vertical circle because then gravity would be part of f net
Aho#7784,Karthik did Dube said anything about those questions yet or no?
J-Klar#4158,I like how I can mute google docs
karthiccc#0069,no she hasnt
karthiccc#0069,but i think i have an idea now
karthiccc#0069,"""i just realized that the question says """"constants"""""""
karthiccc#0069,"""and if you think about it"
karthiccc#0069,so we can assume that the weight of the stopper and radius dont change
karthiccc#0069,if thats the case
karthiccc#0069,"""the """"constant"""" it talks about would be (9.81 x radius) / weight of stopper"""
karthiccc#0069,and that would then be correct
karthiccc#0069,"""only thing that now doesnt make sense is that this """"constant"""" is nothing similar to the slope of my graph"""
karthiccc#0069,so not sure
J-Klar#4158,is G 9.81 or something else
J-Klar#4158,nvm found it
J-Klar#4158,Ye thiccums I got the exact same answer as you
karthiccc#0069,This should be right then
J-Klar#4158,i meant for the sun
J-Klar#4158,if she cant do it i aint gonna

karthiccc#0069,wait jake wdym?
karthiccc#0069,the sun claculation is something we can do

Lucаs#7263,They listened to me
Lucаs#7263,On a separate note have you guys ever had your legs fall asleep when you take a dump? When my hands are on my knees it kinda cuts off the circulation to my legs and I just kinda lost the feeling in my legs and it’s fun to walk around cuz it don’t even feel like you got legs it feels like you have prosthetics. But then you get paralyzed by the tingling sensation for a couple mins 10/10 would recommend
BlazeThief#4311,My body falls asleep
karthiccc#0069,bruh that shit hurts
karthiccc#0069,it dont feel good tf?
BlazeThief#4311,then when blood circulates it feels like I am being ripped apart from the inside out

J-Klar#4158,yo @karthiccc could you send what you did for the analysis questions for the assignment?
karthiccc#0069,#3 is weird but thats what I did
J-Klar#4158,ok thanks yeah thats for num 2 thats what i got
J-Klar#4158,how in the world is your slope 16 lmao
J-Klar#4158,mine was a decimal
karthiccc#0069,bruh i dont even know anymore
karthiccc#0069,thats what my graph showe
J-Klar#4158,weird
J-Klar#4158,this question makes no sense tho
karthiccc#0069,yeah but i mean i dont think she will care too much
J-Klar#4158,truers
J-Klar#4158,nice percent difference LMAO
Pizzanat#6176,why did you do fnet = ft?
karthiccc#0069,lmao ikr
karthiccc#0069,because it is
J-Klar#4158,I just found the FT for each and set them equal
Pizzanat#6176,i'm pretty sure she wanted you to do it similar to how we did a previous note where since both things are now equal to the same fT
Pizzanat#6176,yeah
J-Klar#4158,^
Pizzanat#6176,so you do Fnet = Fg
J-Klar#4158,What he did is still right tho
Pizzanat#6176,i guess
J-Klar#4158,At least my percent difference isn;'t in the thousands I guess
karthiccc#0069,lmao yeah true
Pizzanat#6176,but wait
Pizzanat#6176,math what
Pizzanat#6176,you divided both sides by mass of thingy but the other mass on the other side is unaffected somehow?
Pizzanat#6176,thats probably why
Pizzanat#6176,my percent error is 3.6%
karthiccc#0069,mass of thingy?
karthiccc#0069,you mean stopper or washer
Pizzanat#6176,from the left side
karthiccc#0069,well it doesnt matter because its still multiplication
karthiccc#0069,"""i just put it that way to seperate the """"constant"""" and the mass of the wahers"""
Pizzanat#6176,but how did you get such a different number?
J-Klar#4158,no it does matter
J-Klar#4158,Because it would change the value getting divided
J-Klar#4158,shouldnt it be up top
karthiccc#0069,it would if it was addition but not with multiplication
karthiccc#0069,again it doesnt amtter if it is
Pizzanat#6176,well actually what karthik said is true
Pizzanat#6176,it would be the same anyways
Pizzanat#6176,but how different number you get?
karthiccc#0069,what did you get jasper?
karthiccc#0069,for your number
Pizzanat#6176,i got 75.1
Pizzanat#6176,my slope was 72.5
J-Klar#4158,i got 50.3
J-Klar#4158,but my slope was decimal
J-Klar#4158,i dont get
J-Klar#4158,how u have
J-Klar#4158,high slopes
Pizzanat#6176,but why u slope a decimal?
Pizzanat#6176,maybe you did it wrong in the google sheets?
Pizzanat#6176,why is your velocity so low?
Pizzanat#6176,you probably got super unlucky with the numbers because mine were nice
Pizzanat#6176,apparently jordan had a super slow one too but I dunno why google weird then
J-Klar#4158,What was the fomula to calculate it again?
Pizzanat#6176,for which?
J-Klar#4158,the velocity
J-Klar#4158,its just 2pir over time right?
Pizzanat#6176,yes
Pizzanat#6176,but the 2pir is also x 10
J-Klar#4158,yeah then i got unlucky i guess
Pizzanat#6176,since the time is x 10 or for 10 cycles
J-Klar#4158,?
J-Klar#4158,what do you mean
Pizzanat#6176,like your time is for 10 cycles
J-Klar#4158,yeah but thats fine isn't it
Pizzanat#6176,so you have to get the distance for 10 cycles
J-Klar#4158,o
J-Klar#4158,lmao
Pizzanat#6176,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
J-Klar#4158,so 10x 2pir?
Pizzanat#6176,yeah
J-Klar#4158,mk
Pizzanat#6176,because 0.02 m/s is verrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyy slow
Pizzanat#6176,mine at 0.05 kg was 1.9 m/s
Pizzanat#6176,:D
Pizzanat#6176,but also mine was fast in general
Pizzanat#6176,it did it in 20 seconds vs your 48 seconds
J-Klar#4158,feels bad for me
J-Klar#4158,I had to sit there
J-Klar#4158,and count
karthiccc#0069,jasper show me your graph real quick
Pizzanat#6176,it no let me crop
Pizzanat#6176,so waaaaaaaa
J-Klar#4158,yay now my slope is 48.3
J-Klar#4158,I also have 3.45% diff
Pizzanat#6176,hahhhhhhhhh
J-Klar#4158,Not a thousand poiggers
Pizzanat#6176,and karthik with it over 1000%
J-Klar#4158,LMAO
J-Klar#4158,What did you do karthik?
karthiccc#0069,bruh my graph is wack
J-Klar#4158,Lmao
J-Klar#4158,da heck
karthiccc#0069,like how do I get a slope of 16????
karthiccc#0069,like this shit is just wrong
J-Klar#4158,bro holy crap set that crap to two decimals
J-Klar#4158,leaving it all out
Pizzanat#6176,how fast was your stopper?
Pizzanat#6176,your slope should be insane
karthiccc#0069,IK
karthiccc#0069,but it isnt!!!
karthiccc#0069,because this shit wack
J-Klar#4158,97m/s WHAT THE
J-Klar#4158,Ok flash
J-Klar#4158,chill
Pizzanat#6176,your 0.11 kg is faster than my 0.3 kg
karthiccc#0069,well its the velocity squared
karthiccc#0069,dont forget that
Pizzanat#6176,even for velocity squared
J-Klar#4158,karthik
J-Klar#4158,my fastest velocity squared is 13
karthiccc#0069,bruh this is my normal graph
karthiccc#0069,now if you square those numbers of course its gonna get crazy !!!!
J-Klar#4158,well clearly something is wrong
J-Klar#4158,maybe you timed it badly?
Pizzanat#6176,do you have the trendline correct?
karthiccc#0069,yes it should be
Pizzanat#6176,like the slope?
karthiccc#0069,yes
karthiccc#0069,i dont think i messed up with that
Pizzanat#6176,maybe google messed up
Pizzanat#6176,it goes to over 100 m/s at 0.37 but google says it does 16 m/s at 1 kg
Pizzanat#6176,nice
karthiccc#0069,i dont think I have anything wrong
J-Klar#4158,karthik turn off treat labels as text
J-Klar#4158,it screws with the slope
karthiccc#0069,wait where do you see that
J-Klar#4158,its under the horizontal and vertical axis
J-Klar#4158,its why your graph looks weird
J-Klar#4158,with no verical lines
Pizzanat#6176,also maybe try the mass numbers without kg in the graph's axis
Pizzanat#6176,since you also have kg already with the label
J-Klar#4158,Jasper what are we supposed to write for number 5. Just stating the correlation?
karthiccc#0069,oh shit yeah thats what is what
karthiccc#0069,there we go
J-Klar#4158,dumbass
karthiccc#0069,:)
Pizzanat#6176,nice
karthiccc#0069,ty jasper you lovely being
Pizzanat#6176,so 260 and 245 now
Pizzanat#6176,nice! :D
karthiccc#0069,yeye
Pizzanat#6176,and yes number 5 is just answering the purpose
Pizzanat#6176,where the tension is the force creating the circular motion
J-Klar#4158,The data collected shows a direct correlation between the velocity of the stopper and the mass of the washer should all other variables remain constant. It also shows that the tension is the sole force responsible for creating the circular motion of the stopper. - This seems good right?
Pizzanat#6176,ahh scary english scares me
Pizzanat#6176,but don't forget how it changes when you change mass of the washers which also increase tension force
Pizzanat#6176,wait you did say that
J-Klar#4158,I said velocity
Pizzanat#6176,yeah oops
J-Klar#4158,yar
J-Klar#4158,we gamign

BlazeThief#4311,is this a gore drinker and eclipse vibe thing?
karthiccc#0069,no its kinda the champ tbh

karthiccc#0069,there is no counter play
karthiccc#0069,what so ever
karthiccc#0069,he was annoying before but still very strong
karthiccc#0069,but now with the items he's just terrible to fight
karthiccc#0069,"""they wont remove these items minus altering them a bit"
J-Klar#4158,He has everything in his kit
karthiccc#0069,^
J-Klar#4158,now combine that with an item that gives everything in the game
J-Klar#4158,gg

J-Klar#4158,Honestly dh is just bad
J-Klar#4158,What in the world
J-Klar#4158,It seems awful
J-Klar#4158,Even if you have 20 stacks at level 18 it doesnt outscale electro
J-Klar#4158,and even if it outscaled electro is just so much better early
J-Klar#4158,like dh is actual poop
karthiccc#0069,its easier to proc? i think that maybe why
karthiccc#0069,i dunno
J-Klar#4158,i mean kinda
J-Klar#4158,I just think its bad tbh
J-Klar#4158,i think it needs a buff
karthiccc#0069,also its more of an aditional damage for executing people
J-Klar#4158,i mean for burst damagers past laning phase so is elec
J-Klar#4158,also i kinda do a merak when i run it
J-Klar#4158,i int for the dh
J-Klar#4158,he ints for form
J-Klar#4158,i int for the dh
karthiccc#0069,i mean dont you think dh is just a version of grasp? like grasp with its scaling is not amazing but you take it mainly for the extra damage
J-Klar#4158,no dh is supposed to be hyper scaling
karthiccc#0069,it is?
J-Klar#4158,yeah lol
karthiccc#0069,then yeah it really doesnt feel too helpful

Aho#7784,Kat is a bit broken with only a few items
J-Klar#4158,Yeah its annoying how broken she is
J-Klar#4158,most of her dmg comes from item on hits
J-Klar#4158,whjen she picks uip her blades
J-Klar#4158,but annie and kassadin poop on her
J-Klar#4158,so its ok

J-Klar#4158,I would rather just be 0-0-0 and like 200 farm
J-Klar#4158,than 5-3-2 and like 120

Lucаs#7263,while im out here getting 13 lp per win
karthiccc#0069,feels bad man

J-Klar#4158,Man you really do get such little lp
J-Klar#4158,18 and 2 and I get 22
J-Klar#4158,it should recognize

karthiccc#0069,broken ass champ man jeez
J-Klar#4158,54.8% winrate btw
karthiccc#0069,they should make it so that his q doesnt have a dash
karthiccc#0069,honestly that would be a good enough nerf for him
J-Klar#4158,they should make him banned
karthiccc#0069,lmao they should get him out of the game
karthiccc#0069,make his e duration a lot shorter by like 2 seconds or something
karthiccc#0069,and no dash q

karthiccc#0069,what happened?
J-Klar#4158,nothing was loading even stuff unrelated
J-Klar#4158,and nobody can download the patch
J-Klar#4158,because everyone is tring to
karthiccc#0069,so no game?
J-Klar#4158,they seemed to have fixed steam store and stuff but the download still isn't working
J-Klar#4158,idk
J-Klar#4158,probably soon
J-Klar#4158,just have to wait for them to fix it
J-Klar#4158,literally everyone is trying to download the files
J-Klar#4158,I guess people in zimbabwae will get toplay it first
J-Klar#4158,probably hardly anyone downloading off that server
J-Klar#4158,95% :(
J-Klar#4158,then it just ceases
karthiccc#0069,dang
J-Klar#4158,People are actually so toxic
J-Klar#4158,They freak out so much about something that was obviously gonna happen
J-Klar#4158,as if they cant just wait lmao
J-Klar#4158,yay its working
J-Klar#4158,It seems that the download appearing stuck was never actually a steam issue
J-Klar#4158,just before it downlaoded the patch it was doing a drive only operation
J-Klar#4158,28 secs on the download left me boys
J-Klar#4158,aight pog
BlazeThief#4311,you making that peep then?

Lucаs#7263,Yo cyberpunk has no drm
BlazeThief#4311,yeah I saw that
BlazeThief#4311,what does that even mean thou?
Lucаs#7263,No digital rights management
BlazeThief#4311,what does that mean for getting the game then
Lucаs#7263,"""they don’t need to crack an anti piracy algorithm"
BlazeThief#4311,tdp?
Lucаs#7263,Tpd autocorrect
Lucаs#7263,Tpb
BlazeThief#4311,ohhh
BlazeThief#4311,so you can crack it already?
Lucаs#7263,No
Lucаs#7263,You don’t crack anything
BlazeThief#4311,not crack
BlazeThief#4311,but like
BlazeThief#4311,you can play without buying it
Lucаs#7263,You just download someone else’s crack and play
Lucаs#7263,Codex cracked it
BlazeThief#4311,you gonna do that?
Lucаs#7263,Depends on what jake says about the game
BlazeThief#4311,there is willy customization when you make your character
Lucаs#7263,Ok

J-Klar#4158,CDPR aren't exactly anti pirating
J-Klar#4158,its good
J-Klar#4158,real good
J-Klar#4158,u can choose to be sweater gang
J-Klar#4158,or u can just give yourself a vag
J-Klar#4158,if u inot that
J-Klar#4158,Though the issue with pirating is that its just going to be such an inconvenience when it comes to patches. I dont know how it works but it will be a lot of effort
J-Klar#4158,And there are gonna be patches
J-Klar#4158,For bugs
J-Klar#4158,Not really sure why other people are saying its super unoptimized and hyper buggy with broken textures
J-Klar#4158,Hardly any problems for me

Pizzanat#6176,ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo @BlazeThief @J-Klar @LUCAS @karthiccc  dead by daylight daily login thing is 1000 iridescent shards
BlazeThief#4311,Woagsldkgsl;kdgt
BlazeThief#4311,Gmang
Lucаs#7263,Oh yeah let’s nerf kayn and then buff him with a hot fix after. But taliyah can’t get 3 armour and 75 smaller radius worked ground
Lucаs#7263,Seems legit
karthiccc#0069,High play rate champ vs low play rate champ
karthiccc#0069,Its aint an equal world
karthiccc#0069,I call racism
karthiccc#0069,Taliah lives matter
Lucаs#7263,Nah transphobic
BlazeThief#4311,is she weak or just under played?
J-Klar#4158,yes
J-Klar#4158,Shes just very feast or famine
BlazeThief#4311,Dang
BlazeThief#4311,Kayn dropped like 10 percent win rate
BlazeThief#4311,and apparently
BlazeThief#4311,Taliyah still has 52%
BlazeThief#4311,But it is kinda wack
karthiccc#0069,I saw tarzaned calling her busted lmao
karthiccc#0069,Not so sure how reliable that info is tho
karthiccc#0069,But coming from one of the best jg's NA it could be something to think about
BlazeThief#4311,Was he being serious or just getting smacked and called her busted
Aho#7784,no idea
Aho#7784,I don't watch tarzaned
BlazeThief#4311,I was more asking karthik since he was talking about it lol
Aho#7784,Ik
BlazeThief#4311,I appreciate you either way brotha
Aho#7784,I always appreciate you too
karthiccc#0069,Someone asked him on stream and thats what he was saying
karthiccc#0069,He wasnt fighting it but i couldnt tell if he was being sarcastic
J-Klar#4158,Merak
J-Klar#4158,why
J-Klar#4158,did you make me watch that
karthiccc#0069,Same legit why did i even watch the whole thing
J-Klar#4158,idk
J-Klar#4158,Scuff head
karthiccc#0069,Scuffed indees
BlazeThief#4311,this just the stuff that was sent earlier?
J-Klar#4158,no
J-Klar#4158,way more
J-Klar#4158,yi nerfs
BlazeThief#4311,ooooo dangggg
BlazeThief#4311,Aight
J-Klar#4158,olaf nerfs
J-Klar#4158,slight panth nerf
BlazeThief#4311,dang
BlazeThief#4311,I thought\
BlazeThief#4311,it was gonna be a hot fix for the kayn stuff for today
BlazeThief#4311,but looks like its just on pbe
J-Klar#4158,Archangels buff
J-Klar#4158,noice
BlazeThief#4311,wiat
BlazeThief#4311,confusion
BlazeThief#4311,the tweet says today but this is saying pbe
J-Klar#4158,grevious wounds buff
J-Klar#4158,idk
BlazeThief#4311,maybe they saucing some changes now but some later
BlazeThief#4311,it works on kayn fully now
BlazeThief#4311,his ult be 2.5
BlazeThief#4311,gw is 3 seconds
BlazeThief#4311,ohhhh wait
BlazeThief#4311,I think this is the last pbe they making for the year
BlazeThief#4311,thats why they were saying it will go live
BlazeThief#4311,as in live on pbe
J-Klar#4158,ok then
karthiccc#0069,Wat dat
J-Klar#4158,I need to know merak
J-Klar#4158,did you say it
J-Klar#4158,to yourself
BlazeThief#4311,Kraft Dinner Going Dark - Karthik 2020
BlazeThief#4311,N
BlazeThief#4311,O
J-Klar#4158,11:37pm
BlazeThief#4311,I whispered some cursed secrets

BlazeThief#4311,"""The line """"I cannot call the police they are after me"""" really had me thinking"""
J-Klar#4158,where do you find this crap
Lucаs#7263,youtube
karthiccc#0069,@Aho you a lil early dont ya think?
karthiccc#0069,We still have an hour
Aho#7784,yeah I'm just gonna join cause why not
BlazeThief#4311,My Youtube recommended is something of else
karthiccc#0069,The cursed lands
karthiccc#0069,@Lucаs
karthiccc#0069,t minus 6 min
J-Klar#4158,still dont understand why question 1 includes the period
J-Klar#4158,isnt it not used??
Pizzanat#6176,"""you need it to calculate radius"
karthiccc#0069,^
J-Klar#4158,is the radius not just the radius of earth?
J-Klar#4158,Or is it for the 3 cubed formula or something
karthiccc#0069,the formula
BlazeThief#4311,good luck lads
karthiccc#0069,love you merak
J-Klar#4158,kathik impule is just fnet delta t
karthiccc#0069,or mass * delta V
J-Klar#4158,yeah
J-Klar#4158,si why did u do delta p?
J-Klar#4158,just do m delta v
karthiccc#0069,because the symbol for impulse is delta P
J-Klar#4158,ah
J-Klar#4158,ddint know that
J-Klar#4158,i just wrote m delta v
J-Klar#4158,pepega
karthiccc#0069,lol
J-Klar#4158,can u send ur method for 1
J-Klar#4158,its the only one I cant do
J-Klar#4158,again the first is hard and the rest ez f
karthiccc#0069,i mean technically they all are easy
karthiccc#0069,you probably just didnt spend too much time on the first types of questions
J-Klar#4158,how that a doesnt bounce back tho
J-Klar#4158,i dont understand how ur meant to know that
karthiccc#0069,wait what you mean?
J-Klar#4158,for 5
J-Klar#4158,like why does A not become negative velocity from bouncing back
karthiccc#0069,"""well if a large object hits a smaller object with a velocity"
Pizzanat#6176,because it too big
J-Klar#4158,hot
karthiccc#0069,in reality its what happens
Pizzanat#6176,anyways you wanted 1 jake?
karthiccc#0069,he has different numbers than us
karthiccc#0069,but im pretty sure he has the answer now
J-Klar#4158,no
karthiccc#0069,oh
J-Klar#4158,i dont know how to do it
J-Klar#4158,lmao
J-Klar#4158,i just need to see the method
karthiccc#0069,"""use the gmt^2 = 4pi^2r equation"
Pizzanat#6176,ignore bright light
karthiccc#0069,then use r in the gravitational potential energy
J-Klar#4158,pog thanks
J-Klar#4158,thats what i thought
Pizzanat#6176,wow then y u no do
karthiccc#0069,yo jasper you tryna compare answers?
J-Klar#4158,i dont trust myself
J-Klar#4158,am dumb
Pizzanat#6176,just put the pictures here
karthiccc#0069,bruh
karthiccc#0069,that takes longer
Pizzanat#6176,or look at mine then
Pizzanat#6176,i don't think i made any mistakes
Pizzanat#6176,(for the first time in forever)
BlazeThief#4311,Why the jake lad not with y'all
karthiccc#0069,well my answer for 7c is different
Pizzanat#6176,what did you get?
karthiccc#0069,only because i used sqrt(17/0.15) as w
karthiccc#0069,0.12
karthiccc#0069,i used the exact number of w
Pizzanat#6176,oh yeah
Pizzanat#6176,its probably better too...
Pizzanat#6176,i might change that quickly
karthiccc#0069,what you get for 4 jasper?
karthiccc#0069,and 3?
Pizzanat#6176,you can see
Pizzanat#6176,3: 0.82 m/s 
karthiccc#0069,oh im blind
karthiccc#0069,mb
Pizzanat#6176,4: 4.97 m/s 
Pizzanat#6176,:D
karthiccc#0069,yeah i rounded down for 4
karthiccc#0069,thats why
karthiccc#0069,we got 4.94 
karthiccc#0069,so yeah basically we all right
karthiccc#0069,GG ez
Pizzanat#6176,alright neato
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat i dont think Ns is the same as kgm/s
Pizzanat#6176,in the notes she did use NS and apparently they actually are
Pizzanat#6176,just that NS is used for impulse
karthiccc#0069,wtf
karthiccc#0069,ight then
karthiccc#0069,i wont question it
Pizzanat#6176,so we all good then?
karthiccc#0069,ye
karthiccc#0069,we all gucci
Pizzanat#6176,alright time to spend 30 minutes formatting it beautifully
karthiccc#0069,lmao
karthiccc#0069,at least your's is neat
karthiccc#0069,mine is scuffed to look at
karthiccc#0069,but now thats her problem
Pizzanat#6176,true
J-Klar#4158,jasper for number 4 when you calculate your component vectors for A you use velocity instead of the momentum final
karthiccc#0069,wat
Pizzanat#6176,what do you mean?
J-Klar#4158,for pfay you use your velocitysin40 instead of pfasin40
karthiccc#0069,we used momentum
Pizzanat#6176,i did use velocity to calculate the momentum
Pizzanat#6176,the 2.6sin40 is the velocity x sin40
karthiccc#0069,oh jasper your diagram for 5 should have both balls a and b going in the same direction
karthiccc#0069,you have them in opposites
Pizzanat#6176,do i haveeeeeeeeeee to chang e it though
karthiccc#0069,i mean
karthiccc#0069,up to you
karthiccc#0069,just saying
karthiccc#0069,also jake it shouldnt matter
Pizzanat#6176,"""its more of a thing you make to be like """"oh i know how it might be now"""""""
Pizzanat#6176,:D
karthiccc#0069,but doing it for momentum is easier
J-Klar#4158,yeah but the diagram is all momentum based tho. using trig u need to use the hypotnouse which is momentum not velocity
karthiccc#0069,then do it using momentum
karthiccc#0069,why you trying to do it with velocity?
Pizzanat#6176,do you mean:
J-Klar#4158,im not
J-Klar#4158,he did
J-Klar#4158,to find pfay
J-Klar#4158,when it should be him final momentum
J-Klar#4158,for a
J-Klar#4158,times the sin40
Pizzanat#6176,you're forgetting i multiply it by the mass after too
J-Klar#4158,oh thats weird
J-Klar#4158,ur weird
J-Klar#4158,:(
Pizzanat#6176,thats how she did it in the note i'm pretty sure
Pizzanat#6176,or i dunno
Pizzanat#6176,i forget
J-Klar#4158,idk its the same either way
Pizzanat#6176,but it works for me! :D
karthiccc#0069,lmao who follows the notes
Pizzanat#6176,D:
J-Klar#4158,moi :(((
karthiccc#0069,;D
karthiccc#0069,sadge jasper
Pizzanat#6176,wait so what did she do for the note then?
J-Klar#4158,idk
J-Klar#4158,pretty sure my way
J-Klar#4158,could be wrong
Lucаs#7263,i did the same method as jake and jasp we got same answer
J-Klar#4158,yeah
J-Klar#4158,i checked i
J-Klar#4158,its teh same ans
Lucаs#7263,all good in the hood
Pizzanat#6176,"""just different methods"
Pizzanat#6176,and now we wait for all of us to have messed up a question somehow
Lucаs#7263,nah
Lucаs#7263,we all messed up EVERY QUESTION
Pizzanat#6176,D:
BlazeThief#4311,You lads can play one I'm making lunch
maximumeffort1#3058,have any of you applied for uni or college at all?
J-Klar#4158,Karthik has
maximumeffort1#3058,is he the only one
J-Klar#4158,idk
J-Klar#4158,think

maximumeffort1#3058,Haha you can do the gay in cyberpunk
maximumeffort1#3058,Just thought that was important news
Lucаs#7263,What u bois think has it lived up to the hype?
Lucаs#7263,I just don’t see what’s too great about it tbh but then again I don’t really like single player stuff
maximumeffort1#3058,Haven’t played it yet
maximumeffort1#3058,Kinda feel like it’s going to be another on the pile of open world single player shooters
Lucаs#7263,Yeah idk gotta ask jake cuz he was hyped and he got it
Lucаs#7263,@J-Klar contribute
J-Klar#4158,no
Lucаs#7263,Gay
BlazeThief#4311,if jake ever gonna buy abunch of rp this how you gotta do it
BlazeThief#4311,guy was saying the turkish server its alot cheaper than euw for buying rp not sure if its the same here
Lucаs#7263,WHAT THE FUCK
BlazeThief#4311,HOLY
BlazeThief#4311,Theres alot of insane ones there
Lucаs#7263,"""monster hunter"
BlazeThief#4311,exactly
Lucаs#7263,breakpoint
BlazeThief#4311,r37
Lucаs#7263,origins
BlazeThief#4311,fallout 4
Lucаs#7263,dude im so exited for bl3 tho
BlazeThief#4311,only thing sucks about that is I think lots of people like to mod fallout 4 but since it on wacko games you can't I think
Lucаs#7263,i played it on launch but they added a bunch of stuff to it that the pirated copy never got
BlazeThief#4311,danggg
Lucаs#7263,this actually dope
BlazeThief#4311,monster hunter world is pretty cool aswell
BlazeThief#4311,the whole gang could play
Lucаs#7263,like dauntless bu tnot nhad
Lucаs#7263,bad
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,cooler looking dauntless
J-Klar#4158,i think monster huinter is the only good one
BlazeThief#4311,the monsters actually 1v1 if they find eachother in it
Lucаs#7263,isnt witcher 3 like one of the highest rated games of all time or something?
BlazeThief#4311,Probably
J-Klar#4158,yeha but ive played it
Lucаs#7263,i mean i havent
BlazeThief#4311,same
J-Klar#4158,I was talking for myself but yeah
J-Klar#4158,I didnt like it
J-Klar#4158,not my type of game
J-Klar#4158,personally
J-Klar#4158,me like gun
J-Klar#4158,gun go brrrrrrrrrrrr
Lucаs#7263,borderlands
J-Klar#4158,eh dont really care for it
J-Klar#4158,maybe ill get it
Lucаs#7263,i mean its free
Lucаs#7263,may as well
J-Klar#4158,Yeah but then I have to install epic games
Lucаs#7263,i mean why not just turn off auto launch and remove it from desktop and youll never know its there
J-Klar#4158,Idk dude pretty sure its spying on me
J-Klar#4158,Dont really trust tod sweeny or whatever the ceos name is
Lucаs#7263,tim sweeny
Lucаs#7263,or timothy to close friends
J-Klar#4158,you know him well?
Lucаs#7263,kinda triggered cuz i set the league bot to go afk overnight and windows defender deleted the file because it was flagged as a virus
J-Klar#4158,omega
Lucаs#7263,so it just sat there for 8 hours
J-Klar#4158,you can whitelist it
Lucаs#7263,imma just disable all windows defender functions
J-Klar#4158,what kind of script is it?
J-Klar#4158,cuz it cant be ah right
Lucаs#7263,idk just one i found online
Lucаs#7263,says 10.19 but works with newer versions
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat can u pin  the free games picture?
BlazeThief#4311,not sure that list is too correct
BlazeThief#4311,This ain't no dying light
J-Klar#4158,scammed
J-Klar#4158,yeah apparently that list is wrong
BlazeThief#4311,Sadge
BlazeThief#4311,wanted to play dying light and re7
Lucаs#7263,SADGE
Lucаs#7263,i mean for those games tho just pirate no?
J-Klar#4158,blev
BlazeThief#4311,true
BlazeThief#4311,but
J-Klar#4158,not everybody wants to pirate tho
Lucаs#7263,its the multiplayer ones i was hyped for
BlazeThief#4311,I don't know how
BlazeThief#4311,and my dad has a set ammount per month he can
J-Klar#4158,wut
BlazeThief#4311,uses it for shows and stuff
Lucаs#7263,that aint how it works
J-Klar#4158,thats not
BlazeThief#4311,how it works for his
BlazeThief#4311,not sure why
Lucаs#7263,his what
J-Klar#4158,its really easy merak
BlazeThief#4311,ain't risking it for the biscuit
Lucаs#7263,what is that even supposed to mean
J-Klar#4158,at worst u will get an angry letter from ur isp
J-Klar#4158,and if u cared that much u could just use a vpn
J-Klar#4158,all u do is download torrent files
J-Klar#4158,not sure what you mean for 'his'
Lucаs#7263,and if youre really that concerned get a laptop go to a place with public wifi and sauce a vpn then download it on a laptop from there
J-Klar#4158,a lil overkill lmao
Lucаs#7263,i mean he susd apperaantly
J-Klar#4158,its not illegal or anything lul
BlazeThief#4311,I'll get a burner and then head to a coffee shop
Lucаs#7263,tis
BlazeThief#4311,with 4 vpns
Lucаs#7263,tis illegal
J-Klar#4158,pretty sure uploading is whats illegal
Lucаs#7263,both are
BlazeThief#4311,and my anti virus constantly running a virus scan
J-Klar#4158,eh
J-Klar#4158,How tho
J-Klar#4158,You're not technically breaking a contract
BlazeThief#4311,What if I download league there
J-Klar#4158,which is what makes uploading illeagal
BlazeThief#4311,I can't even get to the page for this crum game
BlazeThief#4311,epic games wack
J-Klar#4158,ye
J-Klar#4158,it cringo
J-Klar#4158,rango
Lucаs#7263,your still downloading copyrighted material
Lucаs#7263,its basically digital stealing
Lucаs#7263,taking somehting you didnt pay for
Lucаs#7263,i think punishment is fines up to 5k
J-Klar#4158,Fuck capitalism
J-Klar#4158,all my homies
J-Klar#4158,hate capitalism
Lucаs#7263,well just use a vpn adn they basically never cath you
Lucаs#7263,so  its no diff
J-Klar#4158,blev the electric potential enegery note has audio
J-Klar#4158,no assignement today tho
Lucаs#7263,oh nvm
J-Klar#4158,poggers
J-Klar#4158,?
Lucаs#7263,its kinda what u said but kinda what i said
J-Klar#4158,another happy ending
Lucаs#7263,its not illegal to download
Lucаs#7263,"""but because of how torrenting works"
J-Klar#4158,well u can turn seeding off
Lucаs#7263,so  ur technically sharing copyrighted stuff
J-Klar#4158,Also I dont think seeding is the same as directly supplying the torrent
J-Klar#4158,pretty sure it actually just assists in speeding up the download
J-Klar#4158,maybe im wrong
Lucаs#7263,its still sharing files that are copyrighted so it would probably be same penalty
Lucаs#7263,and idk whether turning off seeding stops sharing files while u are downloading or if it just turns it off after
Lucаs#7263,cuz i know utorrent basically makes u infinitly seed after u download but idk bout WHILE you downlaodin
J-Klar#4158,no it doesnt lol
J-Klar#4158,or
J-Klar#4158,it didn't use to
J-Klar#4158,u could turn it off
J-Klar#4158,that was a while ago tho
J-Klar#4158,I havent pirated in years
Lucаs#7263,nno i mean by default it makes u seed after u download but you can turn that off
J-Klar#4158,ye
Lucаs#7263,but im not sure about while the process of downloading is going on
J-Klar#4158,u dont
J-Klar#4158,because your a leech instead
Lucаs#7263,that aint how it wokrs
J-Klar#4158,how would u know
J-Klar#4158,idk I dont really think it matters tho
J-Klar#4158,Do people ever actually get fined for downloading
J-Klar#4158,uploading sure maybe
Lucаs#7263,while downloading it also uploads
J-Klar#4158,do u know if thats seeding tho maybe its just something else

J-Klar#4158,Nothing in particular its just every post is just the stupidest stuff
J-Klar#4158,And because downvoted posts are hidding it is quite literally impossible to see another side of a point of view
J-Klar#4158,Which is so counter intuitive
J-Klar#4158,Also Mizkif gave his maids 10000$ bonus and twitter are angry that he shared it because you're not allowed to share nice things you've done
BlazeThief#4311,that just twitter being wack
BlazeThief#4311,people being mad just because they can
J-Klar#4158,Reddit just pretends to be perfect constantly and chastise anyone for any flaws even though they for sure have many of their own.

J-Klar#4158,If I have a thousand dollars and a 1% interest rate I get 10 dollars a month
J-Klar#4158,Thats broken
J-Klar#4158,Let's say you get a sizeable inheritance and add it to ur savings for like 100k total
J-Klar#4158,Thats just a free extra 1k a month
J-Klar#4158,And it just keeps stacking
J-Klar#4158,Soon it'll be 2k
J-Klar#4158,Literally get yourself 200k and you just make butt loads of free cash
Lucаs#7263,Naw
Lucаs#7263,Most interest is calculated yearly
Lucаs#7263,But payed in instalments monthly
Lucаs#7263,It is still sick but not nearly as sick as you think
Lucаs#7263,You gotta take the yearly interest yield and divide by 12 and that would be the monthly instalments
karthiccc#0069,Interest slow af not as fast as you thinking jake
karthiccc#0069,Is it baller? Yeah
karthiccc#0069,But it aint a ton of money

J-Klar#4158,It definitely feels more like a jungle nerf
karthiccc#0069,ye it def is
karthiccc#0069,she could just vibe into a lane way too easily
Lucаs#7263,Gotta love when they buff her for a role people don’t wanna play her in and then nerf all the roles
Lucаs#7263,Like lane taliyah would be better off if they never did any of these changes
karthiccc#0069,well they want her as a jungler now i guess
karthiccc#0069,she legit went from the one of the least played champs to top 20 so quick
Lucаs#7263,Yet they gotta make sure belle delphine isn’t played as support she needs to stay viable as mid because it’s her intended role
Lucаs#7263,Anime
Lucаs#7263,Stripper
Lucаs#7263,Tiddies
J-Klar#4158,good ol toddies
Lucаs#7263,Fuck
karthiccc#0069,i mean i feel like they excepted the fact that she's good in both now
karthiccc#0069,they kinda stopped looking at her now
karthiccc#0069,she still op
karthiccc#0069,in both
karthiccc#0069,but i guess they're fine with that
karthiccc#0069,@J-Klar she said there was gonna be an assignment for today right>
J-Klar#4158,mhm
karthiccc#0069,ight
J-Klar#4158,Bruh you start a game
J-Klar#4158,Without even messaging your boy
J-Klar#4158,Thats messed up
Lucаs#7263,Didn’t she say no assignment today?
Lucаs#7263,That we are gonna get a big one in place of a test tmrw?
Pizzanat#6176,"""if you look at the schedule thingy"
Pizzanat#6176,and none today
J-Klar#4158,oh
J-Klar#4158,dumb
J-Klar#4158,We didn't have on yesterday either
J-Klar#4158,this is scuffed
J-Klar#4158,I don't get why the schedule has to change so much
BlazeThief#4311,Because school be wackness
J-Klar#4158,Did she say when the large assignment will be due? Will it still be due the next day or will we have longer?
J-Klar#4158,THen again we really have only covered one thing I guess and thats just something thats plug and play forumulas
J-Klar#4158,With a little bit of weird fingering
karthiccc#0069,a couple days pretty sure
J-Klar#4158,Ok I just had a brain gasm
J-Klar#4158,You can do control backspace to remove and entire word
J-Klar#4158,Insane
BlazeThief#4311,You never knew that?
BlazeThief#4311,It is pretty pogchampion
J-Klar#4158,I had no idea
J-Klar#4158,Its been a pain in my life for so long
BlazeThief#4311,Life has now changed for you lad
BlazeThief#4311,the good days are here
J-Klar#4158,Are there any more gaming shortcuts I should no about
BlazeThief#4311,None that I can remember
BlazeThief#4311,though if your game is not responding and you can't open task manager cause of it
J-Klar#4158,I know
BlazeThief#4311,windows + tab lets you choose from 3 different desktop things
BlazeThief#4311,pogchamp
J-Klar#4158,wait wut
BlazeThief#4311,try it
J-Klar#4158,just ctrl shift esc
BlazeThief#4311,windows + tab
BlazeThief#4311,nah since
BlazeThief#4311,sometimes the games go over the task manager so you cant click it
BlazeThief#4311,so you switch the desktop and do it on the other one
J-Klar#4158,Good point
J-Klar#4158,sometimes they force themselves first tho
BlazeThief#4311,truth
J-Klar#4158,in which case it still might not help
J-Klar#4158,Games are wacko
BlazeThief#4311,They do be
BlazeThief#4311,Though if you do the thing it opens a whole new desktop so the game isn't even on the screen anymore
BlazeThief#4311,just blank
J-Klar#4158,lmao
J-Klar#4158,true
J-Klar#4158,I still don't understand the purpose of multiple desktrops
karthiccc#0069,nice to use when only having one monitor
J-Klar#4158,How tho
J-Klar#4158,What advantages does it bring
karthiccc#0069,can switch between 2 working environments quickly
BlazeThief#4311,I've never used it besides the task manager thing but I can see it being kinda sick
J-Klar#4158,Isn't it just alt tabbing with extra steps
J-Klar#4158,Im so confused
J-Klar#4158,On its purpose
BlazeThief#4311,I guess
karthiccc#0069,i had i micro for it so not reall
BlazeThief#4311,but also probably makes it easier if you have tabs or something
BlazeThief#4311,like for school or something
BlazeThief#4311,more organized kinda vibe
BlazeThief#4311,Though don't think I'd try using it
J-Klar#4158,I think I'm just missing the point
J-Klar#4158,I seriously don't understand the point at all.
J-Klar#4158,Reverse annie or panda annie?
J-Klar#4158,yall decide
J-Klar#4158,Aight nobody decided so I did instead
BlazeThief#4311,Reverse Better
BlazeThief#4311,if you didn't choose that
BlazeThief#4311,Then
BlazeThief#4311,bad
J-Klar#4158,I did choose it :)
BlazeThief#4311,Annie in the panda one looks crum form the splash art if I remember correctly
J-Klar#4158,idk about that
J-Klar#4158,bruh our riven had 153 ability haste

J-Klar#4158,Who joined cuz im pooping
J-Klar#4158,Nvm ot was the post game lobby
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah mans kinda made a scuffed mans move
BlazeThief#4311,Apparently a lot of his friends not liking him too much
maximumeffort1#3058,Why tf did that send twice
maximumeffort1#3058,Slime totally renounced him
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah I read that earlier mans just was like aight Imma head out
BlazeThief#4311,makes sense why
BlazeThief#4311,wouldn't really be vibing with that
Lucаs#7263,is this callmecarson or somthing
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
maximumeffort1#3058,He groomed a couple 17 year olds
Lucаs#7263,ok i mean how old is he tho
maximumeffort1#3058,21 now he did it when he was 19
Lucаs#7263,ok thats not even that wack
Lucаs#7263,idk about the laws in merica but in canada thats legal
Lucаs#7263,if they banged not if they sent nudes and shit
maximumeffort1#3058,The problem is that he used his fame for nudes
BlazeThief#4311,He had nudes of her
BlazeThief#4311,they sent back and forth
BlazeThief#4311,so he had child stuff technically
maximumeffort1#3058,Which is technically child porn in the Mercia
Lucаs#7263,"""yeah thats where the system is kinda fucked up he could literally have sex with her"
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
maximumeffort1#3058,Yeah so he’s totally cancelled now
J-Klar#4158,Yeah but wasn't that whole thing where he kinda got fitz cancelled a bunch of bull too
BlazeThief#4311,I saw someone say that but not sure if it true
maximumeffort1#3058,Yeah earlier this year when his girlfriend cheated on him with fitz
Lucаs#7263,bruh this kinda funny
Lucаs#7263,"""""""yeah i get u other stuff"""""""
Lucаs#7263,"""""""so next time ur horny"""""""
BlazeThief#4311,Bruh
BlazeThief#4311,In one ear out the other
BlazeThief#4311,Hes only a month off of being 20 there aswell
maximumeffort1#3058,damn whered you find that
J-Klar#4158,I shared my dms with him
J-Klar#4158,kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarthik
J-Klar#4158,lmao
BlazeThief#4311,Mans be sketching me out
J-Klar#4158,is there something about being a youtuber that also does minecraft content that makes you a creep
BlazeThief#4311,Honestly like what in the world
J-Klar#4158,What in the world did I just read
J-Klar#4158,That was the weirdest thing I have ever read
BlazeThief#4311,And you call me weird
J-Klar#4158,I like how she doesn't even care that he literalyl calls her unstable
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah its hella sketch
maximumeffort1#3058,Damn he knew it was wrong and still did it
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah mans was like
BlazeThief#4311,"""""""I don't think we should be doing this stuff it badness"""""""
BlazeThief#4311,then was like
BlazeThief#4311,"""""""Nah nevermind"""""""
maximumeffort1#3058,Part of me wants to feel bad for him but I know hes a scumbag
Lucаs#7263,yeah i mean it really depends on how he said and did the stuff
Lucаs#7263,but some of the things he was saying were just weird
BlazeThief#4311,Thats not even all of the things he said I think
BlazeThief#4311,Weren't people saying he was doing that kind of thing with multiple people or was it just the one
karthiccc#0069,what is it jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake
maximumeffort1#3058,He also did the same thing with two other girls
Lucаs#7263,I honestly didnt know you could get into big trouble for that
maximumeffort1#3058,It’s called grooming
maximumeffort1#3058,Using your fame/power or something to get underaged people to do things for you
Lucаs#7263,oh i thought it was just about the underage thing
maximumeffort1#3058,Nah he was using his status
maximumeffort1#3058,Which is a shitty thing to do
J-Klar#4158,Thats not what grooming is
J-Klar#4158,Its only grooming because their minors
J-Klar#4158,Its somebodies choice to sleep with someone else because they're rich or famous
maximumeffort1#3058,Oh still a shitty thing to do
maximumeffort1#3058,He’s taking advantage of the fact he’s a youtuber
karthiccc#0069,consent is consent
maximumeffort1#3058,No dumbass its not
karthiccc#0069,i mean we aint talking about 14 year olds here are we?
maximumeffort1#3058,17 is underage therefor no consent
Lucаs#7263,legit so wack tho my brother met his girlfriend when she was 19 and he was 17
maximumeffort1#3058,But it’s technically legal here
karthiccc#0069,17 is old enough to make decisions by yourself
maximumeffort1#3058,Its not in the land of the us
Lucаs#7263,I think at the end of the day no matter how old you are having a 17 year olds nudes is child pornography
karthiccc#0069,well yeah it is
maximumeffort1#3058,Don’t mean it’s legal karthik
karthiccc#0069,fair enough
maximumeffort1#3058,He still did an illegal thing no matter if she consented or nah
karthiccc#0069,ok yeah that i can agree with
maximumeffort1#3058,Not the most attractive man
Lucаs#7263,booty is in the eye of the beholder
maximumeffort1#3058,I mean
maximumeffort1#3058,Still not a looker though
karthiccc#0069,is he over 6ft?
Lucаs#7263,i think hes pretty good lookin
Lucаs#7263,doesnt look too shabby
karthiccc#0069,that number doesnt look too shabby?
Lucаs#7263,oh I didnt even see that haha
maximumeffort1#3058,Yeah he’s tall I think
BlazeThief#4311,Ruined King might be shown soon
BlazeThief#4311,Since some of the skins in the preview were part of the ruined skinline
J-Klar#4158,@karthiccc Leaguing?
Lucаs#7263,No
J-Klar#4158,Didn't ask you
maximumeffort1#3058,yes the number of my friends that play that game is dwindling!
J-Klar#4158,why you gotta be a hater constantly
maximumeffort1#3058,because i have nothing better to do
maximumeffort1#3058,it makes me feel better about the games i play
BlazeThief#4311,What games do you even play
BlazeThief#4311,Besides rust right now
J-Klar#4158,The 11.1 patch actually comes out today and tmrw before the ranked season which is cool

Lucаs#7263,No
maximumeffort1#3058,i just got dark souls three and yakuza 0
J-Klar#4158,Not right now but by sometime tmrw
karthiccc#0069,oh shit bitcoin hit 40k damn
karthiccc#0069,lucas you tryna start the mining buisness?
J-Klar#4158,It must be so god damn awful to mine bitcoin now
karthiccc#0069,i couldnt tell ya if it is but i wouldnt see how it would be harder than before
karthiccc#0069,same procedure
karthiccc#0069,just the value is greater
J-Klar#4158,do you not udnerstand how mining works?
J-Klar#4158,its much much harder
J-Klar#4158,the more thats mined the harder it becomes lmao
J-Klar#4158,pretty sure bitcoin is dead when it comes to mining
J-Klar#4158,youd have to mine something smaller
karthiccc#0069,oh yeah true
karthiccc#0069,nvm then yeah
karthiccc#0069,just read up on it quick
J-Klar#4158,lul
J-Klar#4158,Youd need like super computer
J-Klar#4158,makes more sense to just trade
karthiccc#0069,yeah it really is not worth mining
J-Klar#4158,yup
karthiccc#0069,but not like we can afford full whole bitcoins
karthiccc#0069,would have to buy fractions of it
J-Klar#4158,ok so?
karthiccc#0069,true
J-Klar#4158,Hardly anyone can lul
J-Klar#4158,I have like 2000 spares if you want a couple tho
karthiccc#0069,lmao yes ill take one
J-Klar#4158,sadge I remember when bitcoin cost like 50 dollars
karthiccc#0069,that was back in like 2012 wasnt it
J-Klar#4158,something like that
karthiccc#0069,honestly depresso
J-Klar#4158,thats literally insane
J-Klar#4158,8 years and like what an 800 times increase in price
karthiccc#0069,i guess
karthiccc#0069,its a 8000% increase
karthiccc#0069,from 2013
J-Klar#4158,what did it cost then
karthiccc#0069,300 ish
J-Klar#4158,thats  like 133 times
J-Klar#4158,.34 to be cool
karthiccc#0069,still a massive increase
J-Klar#4158,true dat
J-Klar#4158,the existence of it makes no sense to me though
J-Klar#4158,Like it literally only exists to be traded
karthiccc#0069,ya i remember trying to understand how it worked but never understoof
J-Klar#4158,I don't really understand where the value comes from
karthiccc#0069,no idea either
karthiccc#0069,blockchain?
J-Klar#4158,I suppose thats like any form of currency
karthiccc#0069,not really
J-Klar#4158,Like the dollar isn't actually worth anything
karthiccc#0069,currency was gold but now is based on debt
karthiccc#0069,innit?
J-Klar#4158,Sort of
J-Klar#4158,But the money that we all own is kinda worthless. Like the canadian dollar is only worth something because we all agree to assign it a value
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,thats for anything
J-Klar#4158,its why preppers usually own gold and stuff
J-Klar#4158,because if government fell it would stil have a value
J-Klar#4158,cuz ballers gotta have that bling
karthiccc#0069,id rather buy coffee beans
J-Klar#4158,bottlecaps poggers
karthiccc#0069,whats the point of precious metal when the world falls apart
karthiccc#0069,lmao yeah
J-Klar#4158,Wouldn't wheat be like the best idea
J-Klar#4158,or seeds in general
karthiccc#0069,"""wheat"
karthiccc#0069,meat especially too
J-Klar#4158,Well the issue with that is that it spoils
J-Klar#4158,you want non perishables dont you
karthiccc#0069,oh i know the holy trinity for currency
karthiccc#0069,alcohol
J-Klar#4158,Isn't wheat used for alcohol
J-Klar#4158,or something like wheat
karthiccc#0069,nah thats why i said barley
J-Klar#4158,aight but what are the other two things
karthiccc#0069,wdym?
karthiccc#0069,what other two things?>
J-Klar#4158,You said holy trinity
karthiccc#0069,wait the holy trinity has 3 things?
J-Klar#4158,What do you think trinity means
J-Klar#4158,are you
J-Klar#4158,retarded?
karthiccc#0069,yes
J-Klar#4158,The father the son the ghost?
karthiccc#0069,i just thought holy trinity meant best thing
J-Klar#4158,or trinity force that was built out of 3 components
J-Klar#4158,each that did something unique...
karthiccc#0069,ok yeah that makes more sense
J-Klar#4158,LMAO
karthiccc#0069,ok yeah im just retarded
karthiccc#0069,and uneducated
karthiccc#0069,"""then in that case jake"
karthiccc#0069,and clothing
karthiccc#0069,"""so alcohol to keep you sane"
J-Klar#4158,What about porn
J-Klar#4158,I feel that would be sort of vital
J-Klar#4158,Considering there would be no electricity
J-Klar#4158,It would actually go for lots probs
J-Klar#4158,also kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarthik play leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeague
karthiccc#0069,nah prostitution
karthiccc#0069,also nah jake i be watchin movie

Pizzanat#6176,send a pic of your solutions
Pizzanat#6176,oh wait nevermind its fine
Pizzanat#6176,i was using the wrong radius
karthiccc#0069,ah
Pizzanat#6176,because the question gave two and it was weird
karthiccc#0069,wdym 2?
karthiccc#0069,there was only 1
Pizzanat#6176,well i wrote down the separation of the parallel plates as r
Pizzanat#6176,so my brain used that as r
karthiccc#0069,hmmmmmmm
karthiccc#0069,supposed to be D
karthiccc#0069,but you know
karthiccc#0069,whatever
Pizzanat#6176,i use r
Pizzanat#6176,:D
karthiccc#0069,so did you get 2049 then?
Pizzanat#6176,2048

maximumeffort1#3058,Hi jimspar
Lucаs#7263,yo @Pizzanat @karthiccc im just assuming for q1 we just use mu not for air or whatever
Pizzanat#6176,Yes
Pizzanat#6176,She said to assume it is air unless told otherwise
Lucаs#7263,ok sounds good G also did u guys get north direction was out of page
Pizzanat#6176,yes
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat 1a what did you do for direction
Lucаs#7263,it doesnt give you any info to use
Lucаs#7263,yet it is still a vector
Pizzanat#6176,well it tells you to find the direction for 1b
Lucаs#7263,so did you just leave it out of 1a?
Pizzanat#6176,yeah
Lucаs#7263,crum
Pizzanat#6176,"""and normally"
Pizzanat#6176,or if not i guess you could also say clockwise
Pizzanat#6176,so nevermind
Lucаs#7263,yeah like if it said wether it was north or south
Pizzanat#6176,yeah
Pizzanat#6176,like the direction of it specifically north of the wire
Lucаs#7263,ight my man it was sketching me out
Lucаs#7263,I just wrote out if north in if south
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat 2b is west me boi?
Pizzanat#6176,yees
Lucаs#7263,baller
Lucаs#7263,poimst
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat for q3 do u just ignore vector directions since u dont get them or do u use rhr to determine the directions?
Pizzanat#6176,well you don't need direction to calculate current so it doesn't matter
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat 4a got me wacked why would it provide 4mm if not used and karthiks formula should be deltaVq=1/2mv^2 so velocity initial would be zero but we dont know voltage initial
Pizzanat#6176,it still calculates the voltage that way so it also works
Pizzanat#6176,its weird because you don't have to use the 4 mm
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat idk me boi seems off
Lucаs#7263,care to join? we discussting

J-Klar#4158,Is the only way through levelling up?
Pizzanat#6176,that and special login events

J-Klar#4158,Maybe there will be one for easter
Pizzanat#6176,maybe
J-Klar#4158,Thats still a lot kinda
Pizzanat#6176,yeah
Pizzanat#6176,it takes a lot of time to level up enough to get 2000
Pizzanat#6176,so cosmetics scary
Pizzanat#6176,but its okay since i am happy with my perks hah
Pizzanat#6176,and i don't play killer because every time i've tried i lost connection
Pizzanat#6176,5 times all on different days when survivor games worked well

J-Klar#4158,oh yeah
J-Klar#4158,it is

Lucаs#7263,Apparently because she and some other ppl were just trying to vibe and role play and xqc made a gang and just roamed and killed people

BlazeThief#4311,however you also said that you don't think building a cool base in minecraft is worth it as its just a skin for a dirt shack
BlazeThief#4311,You truly are a interesting lad
Lucаs#7263,Yeah man what can I say
Lucаs#7263,I think it’s because skins cost money that when they are free I’m more exited for them but in mine craft it really don’t matter what u build with
BlazeThief#4311,I see you but does this mean that you do think skins be cool just don't like saucing the moneys to get them and rather wait till cool free ones out
Lucаs#7263,"""It’s just my new instincts merak I’m not gonna pay really money for a skin"

Lucаs#7263,Not to say I don’t like subway

Lucаs#7263,I just don’t like spending money there cuz it’s expensive
BlazeThief#4311,when did these primordial instincts arise?
Lucаs#7263,Basically as soon as I got a job
Lucаs#7263,I was like sheeiet I don’t wanna work
BlazeThief#4311,So its like you would buy subway on occasion if it had a baller deal
Lucаs#7263,So I gotta save so one day I can just chill ax
BlazeThief#4311,but you would always wait for that deal or a free coupon kinda deal
Lucаs#7263,I mean sometimes on rare occasion I’ll buy one but I don’t like it cuz u could literally go to the grocery store and make the exact same thing for way less
BlazeThief#4311,If only you could make your own skin
Lucаs#7263,Some games u can
BlazeThief#4311,I used it when playing with jasper for awhile

Lucаs#7263,I think a feature if you become the champion you inherit their passive as well
Lucаs#7263,Although it may be a bug because fiddles ward passive doesn’t work
Lucаs#7263,But that could be either way
Lucаs#7263,Could be a fiddle problem or an everyone else problem
BlazeThief#4311,do you inherit level aswell?
Lucаs#7263,I hav no clue
BlazeThief#4311,looks like you don't from that video
BlazeThief#4311,wonder how that would work for ornn then since doesn't he get upgrades after a certain level
Lucаs#7263,You probably just get whatever level you have at the moment
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,but doesn't ornn get his upgrade for the lads at like 13 or something and then every level or so after
BlazeThief#4311,Just wondering if a level 18 viego killed the lad and became him if he could upgrade all his teams items or just one

J-Klar#4158,I have to eat in 15
karthiccc#0069,Ight
karthiccc#0069,Message me after eatin if u down
J-Klar#4158,Im glad they made banshees actually an item
J-Klar#4158,and im glad they fixed verdant from being a weird item
J-Klar#4158,and just awful compared to armguard
Aho#7784,Yeah that is true
J-Klar#4158,oh damn the assignment just has set numbers
karthiccc#0069,share answres then?
J-Klar#4158,Have u done 4?
karthiccc#0069,still on 2
J-Klar#4158,o
karthiccc#0069,just started basically
J-Klar#4158,wait what are ur numbers for the first question
J-Klar#4158,we might not have been given the same
J-Klar#4158,nvm is the same
J-Klar#4158,for 1 I got 1.52x10-3m
J-Klar#4158,2 I got 3.9m
karthiccc#0069,for 1 i got 1.52x10^-5 tho
karthiccc#0069,oh nvm
karthiccc#0069,did something wron
karthiccc#0069,mb
J-Klar#4158,yeah u just solve for x1
J-Klar#4158,and then thats the spacing
J-Klar#4158,im pre sure
karthiccc#0069,ye\
karthiccc#0069,i just used the wrong power
karthiccc#0069,i got 1.28m for 2
karthiccc#0069,what did you do?
karthiccc#0069,@J-Klar
J-Klar#4158,just solved for l
J-Klar#4158,L=(x1 * d) / lambda
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,thats right
karthiccc#0069,but then what numbers did you use?
J-Klar#4158,oh mb
J-Klar#4158,forgot to divide it by 3
karthiccc#0069,ahh gotchaq
karthiccc#0069,yeah
J-Klar#4158,let me know what you get for 4
karthiccc#0069,i got 5.9x10^-4 cm
karthiccc#0069,@J-Klar
J-Klar#4158,O? I got x10-7m which isn't the same
J-Klar#4158,pretty sure mine is right tho
J-Klar#4158,cuz its listed in nm on google
J-Klar#4158,which is x10-7m
karthiccc#0069,for what?
J-Klar#4158,yellow light
karthiccc#0069,yeah but if you kept it all as cm then
karthiccc#0069,what do you get?
karthiccc#0069,oh fuck
karthiccc#0069,didvied by 6 not 60
karthiccc#0069,so that makes it 10-5
karthiccc#0069,cm
karthiccc#0069,which is then right
J-Klar#4158,yes
J-Klar#4158,Yay ya boy got accepted to laurier
J-Klar#4158,damn jake thats so cool congrats
BlazeThief#4311,damn jake thats so cool congrats
Lucаs#7263,damn jake thats so cool congrats
J-Klar#4158,So you were all here to comment but you just chosen not to until I complained
J-Klar#4158,its ok
J-Klar#4158,im fine
Lucаs#7263,nah i just got here
BlazeThief#4311,nah i just got here
J-Klar#4158,:Oh:
Lucаs#7263,anyone know what is going on here
Lucаs#7263,the value of sin0 is 0.125
Lucаs#7263,but when you do sin-1 of 0.125 you do not get 30 or even 14 degrees
J-Klar#4158,What do you get
Lucаs#7263,like 0.15
J-Klar#4158,is ur calc in radians?
Lucаs#7263,FUCK
J-Klar#4158,ahaha yeah I kept doing that too
J-Klar#4158,whenever you get randomly small numbers
J-Klar#4158,thats why
Lucаs#7263,k but now i just got 7.1 but it says 30
Lucаs#7263,still scuffed
J-Klar#4158,well that I cant help u with
J-Klar#4158,I didnt do the practice just the assignment
Lucаs#7263,"""this was for day 1"
Lucаs#7263,for q2
J-Klar#4158,wut
J-Klar#4158,q2 of what lol
Lucаs#7263,assingment
J-Klar#4158,todays?
Lucаs#7263,nah
Lucаs#7263,19
J-Klar#4158,lemme see
Lucаs#7263,Two speakers are 1.25 m apart and vibrate in phase to produce waves of wavelength 0.24 m.  Determine the angle to the first constructive interference.
Lucаs#7263,woudlnt the first construtive interference just be the one on the bisector there?
Lucаs#7263,that i do not get
Lucаs#7263,feels like it should be 0
J-Klar#4158,no
Lucаs#7263,m shoudl = 0
J-Klar#4158,0 is just the zeroeth
J-Klar#4158,1st is actualyl second
J-Klar#4158,dude just think of it as an array
Lucаs#7263,questinos asks for first doe
J-Klar#4158,it means position 1
Lucаs#7263,determine angle to first constructive interference
Lucаs#7263,technically 0 is the first like you said
J-Klar#4158,sure then put that
Lucаs#7263,NO
Lucаs#7263,wack
J-Klar#4158,u realise it doesn't matter what u put right
Lucаs#7263,y
J-Klar#4158,this isn't getting marked
Lucаs#7263,wdym
J-Klar#4158,its late
J-Klar#4158,it doesn't get marked
J-Klar#4158,were you not in the google meet
Lucаs#7263,it literally says due tmrw
Lucаs#7263,8am
Lucаs#7263,she meant anytrhing after that date
J-Klar#4158,its not supposed to lol
Lucаs#7263,after wednesdaty
J-Klar#4158,she said u have the next day for each assignment to turn it in
J-Klar#4158,didn't she?
Lucаs#7263,nah i thought she said anything turned in after wednesday
Lucаs#7263,no mark
J-Klar#4158,I don't know dude
J-Klar#4158,also I dont care
J-Klar#4158,just do the 2nd but technically first
J-Klar#4158,thats clearly what she wants
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat @karthiccc what did you put my G if u have a sec
Pizzanat#6176,For what?
Lucаs#7263,q2 day19
Lucаs#7263,the first constructive interference happens at m=0
Lucаs#7263,but that would make the angle 0
Lucаs#7263,which is a bit odd for the question
Pizzanat#6176,Pretty sure she means for the first one above the bisector
J-Klar#4158,^
Pizzanat#6176,Thats how she has always done it
Pizzanat#6176,"""Well"
Pizzanat#6176,as long as m = 1
Lucаs#7263,it makes more sense but its just so garbo
J-Klar#4158,eh
J-Klar#4158,not really
J-Klar#4158,why would there ever be a question on m=0
J-Klar#4158,there doesn't need to be
Lucаs#7263,"""in the video she literally says """"The first constructive interference here at m=0"""""""
J-Klar#4158,cuz its always the same
J-Klar#4158,in yo mama she said cringe
Lucаs#7263,just wacks me out
Pizzanat#6176,For questions I remember her referring to the first ones not on the bisector though
Pizzanat#6176,So I just went with that
Lucаs#7263,ig
karthiccc#0069,damn jake thats so cool congrats
karthiccc#0069,Sorry im a little late to the party
J-Klar#4158,:Klarmeiser:
karthiccc#0069,Ill have a drink to celebrate your accomplishment jakey
karthiccc#0069,Dw
J-Klar#4158,I wasn't
Lucаs#7263,now he is
Aho#7784,Well I got league on mobile lol
maximumeffort1#3058,"""You know"
J-Klar#4158,@LUCAS She refers to the bright spot on the right bisector as the 0th in one of the new videos
Lucаs#7263,THATS WHAT IM SAYING
Lucаs#7263,It’s the 0th bright spot I know that
Lucаs#7263,But it is also the first occurance of a bright spot
J-Klar#4158,ye i was just reassuring you that you put the right thing
Lucаs#7263,Yeah if she said that in the other videos all would be good at least I know now
J-Klar#4158,ive never seen something as pointless as all of this
karthiccc#0069,like this unit?
Lucаs#7263,We will never know
J-Klar#4158,all of it
J-Klar#4158,ALL OF IT
J-Klar#4158,but yeah this unit dumb
J-Klar#4158,I dont like physics
J-Klar#4158,boring
Lucаs#7263,True dat
Lucаs#7263,This unit at least not all of it
karthiccc#0069,maybe you'd want to calculate the refraction of light off your balls for the most efficient shit
karthiccc#0069,i dont know where I was going with that
karthiccc#0069,you guys understand the thin film shit?
J-Klar#4158,i mean sort of
J-Klar#4158,what dont you understand about it
Lucаs#7263,We will never know
J-Klar#4158,yup
J-Klar#4158,@karthiccc Howd you go about doing number 3 on the assignment
J-Klar#4158,I mean I think I did it right but im really not sure
J-Klar#4158,Especially because im confused on if ur supposed to go about it as constructive or deconstructive
karthiccc#0069,havent even started the assignment
karthiccc#0069,ill tell you when I get there
karthiccc#0069,oh wait nvm i can answer that question rn
J-Klar#4158,its deconstructive right?
karthiccc#0069,ye it is
J-Klar#4158,aight
J-Klar#4158,cuz only one has a ps
karthiccc#0069,there is a phaseshift so you'll t = lambda/2n
karthiccc#0069,then isolate for lambda
Lucаs#7263,holdup
Lucаs#7263,how do you get that its destructive
Lucаs#7263,is it the minimally reflecxted part
karthiccc#0069,ye
karthiccc#0069,they dont wanna see the light
karthiccc#0069,if you dont see light = deconstructive
karthiccc#0069,see light? = constructive
J-Klar#4158,oh I just thought it was decon becuz only one thing was phase shifted meaning it ended up being crest to trough
Lucаs#7263,wdym by that it never mentions that
J-Klar#4158,...
J-Klar#4158,no it doens't lol
J-Klar#4158,its just how it works
J-Klar#4158,it doesnt phase shift if the second material is a lower n value
Lucаs#7263,so what you just ignore the last layer of glass or whatever
karthiccc#0069,well i mean the thing is if there is a reflection but you dont wanna see it
karthiccc#0069,it is deconstructive technically
karthiccc#0069,or the way it works is decon because you want crest to trough
Lucаs#7263,k i get why its destructice but i dont get how jake deduces it
J-Klar#4158,did u not watch the videos?
Lucаs#7263,i did
J-Klar#4158,then watch them again
J-Klar#4158,ez
J-Klar#4158,clap
J-Klar#4158,pog \
Lucаs#7263,@J-Klar a phase shift just means that the reflected wave is oposite to the original wave right?
J-Klar#4158,yes
J-Klar#4158,and it only happens when the medium it is reflecting off has a higher refraction index than what it would be reflecting through
karthiccc#0069,did you guys get an answer in the ten millions for question 1?
J-Klar#4158,um no?
J-Klar#4158,what the
J-Klar#4158,did u do x106 not -6
J-Klar#4158,ur supposed to do -6
karthiccc#0069,yeah I know
karthiccc#0069,wait oh nvm im retarded af
karthiccc#0069,god damn
J-Klar#4158,ok
karthiccc#0069,thousands
karthiccc#0069,yeah?
J-Klar#4158,something like that
karthiccc#0069,we ready for the test boys?
J-Klar#4158,What time is it?
karthiccc#0069,time for a drink
J-Klar#4158,I was being serious I joined the google meet 5 minutes late and it was just her and one other person
Lucаs#7263,11
karthiccc#0069,for review its at 8
karthiccc#0069,like normal
karthiccc#0069,pretty sure
karthiccc#0069,but then again that info is from me
Lucаs#7263,Join at 8:30 for attendance  test is 11-12:30-
maximumeffort1#3058,dont know what it is but good luck
maximumeffort1#3058,ok
karthiccc#0069,yo lucas.... your really should have gotten into the stock market man
karthiccc#0069,shits getting fucked up
Lucаs#7263,like half a month now no point in doing some scuffed crap with my parents
Lucаs#7263,that ship has sailed
karthiccc#0069,Man and your 18 only jusy a couple weeks now
Lucаs#7263,yes
Lucаs#7263,also jake ur gonna hate me but i still think ur wrong about q3
Lucаs#7263,this is the exact same scenario as the question 3 and the fact that there is one phase shift has no effect on whether or not the question is about constructive or destructive interference as she gives a case for each type of interference
Lucаs#7263,i think its just destructive because of the wording
Pizzanat#6176,the fact that there is a phase shift does not affect whether you need to consider with constructive or destructive
Pizzanat#6176,and yeah its just wording
Lucаs#7263,aight my insanity paid off lets go
Pizzanat#6176,how long did you spend figuring it out?
Lucаs#7263,probably like 1.5 hours
Lucаs#7263,maybe only 1
Lucаs#7263,who knows
Lucаs#7263,not terribly long
Pizzanat#6176,is that the only thing you were trying to figure out?
Lucаs#7263,"""i still dont get why you just ignore any refraction from the second medium"
Pizzanat#6176,what do you mean?
Lucаs#7263,or the third the 1.3
Pizzanat#6176,because we don't consider it as it goes through
Pizzanat#6176,so hah
Lucаs#7263,why not tho
Lucаs#7263,does it no go through?
Pizzanat#6176,it probably does
Pizzanat#6176,we just don't need to consider it
Lucаs#7263,do YOU even know the reason why?
Pizzanat#6176,because we are asked for one thing only?
Lucаs#7263,but whoudlnt the rays also come out of the 1.3 into the 1.5 then into the 1 again and affect the end result?
Lucаs#7263,like this
Pizzanat#6176,well apparently we don't have to worry about it?
Lucаs#7263,yeah thats the conclusion I came to
Lucаs#7263,just forget about it
Pizzanat#6176,it probably wouldn't affect the end result too much
Lucаs#7263,idk man looks like theres a third ray there to me
Lucаs#7263,33% more rays
Pizzanat#6176,well there would normally be a million rays anyways
Lucаs#7263,33% more millions
Pizzanat#6176,but we don't consider them probably because it doesn't change it
Pizzanat#6176,so i guess thats it
karthiccc#0069,It is deconstructive innit?
karthiccc#0069,Who said it aint
Pizzanat#6176,for the assignment?
Pizzanat#6176,minimally reflected so yeah destructive
karthiccc#0069,Yeah exactyl
karthiccc#0069,Whats lucas tryna prove?
Pizzanat#6176,i dunno
Lucаs#7263,jake was saying that he got the destructive part from the fact that there was one phase shift
Pizzanat#6176,hah i was too lazy to read the previous conversation
karthiccc#0069,No you get destructive from yhe fact that its less reflective
Lucаs#7263,yeah i know that now
Lucаs#7263,also
Lucаs#7263,I cant help it bro its in my DNA
Aho#7784,Are y’all gonna be on call tmrw?
J-Klar#4158,Wait if that's the case whats the whole point in the phase shift crap
Lucаs#7263,It’s to see which equation to use for 2t
Aho#7784,too see if the constructive or destructive has the 2t thing
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat
karthiccc#0069,join
karthiccc#0069,for once
Pizzanat#6176,Are we just doing review?
Pizzanat#6176,I'm good for now
karthiccc#0069,for now
Pizzanat#6176,I'll join in a bit
karthiccc#0069,then join during test?
Pizzanat#6176,Maybe
Pizzanat#6176,Also my nose is bleeding so also not yet
karthiccc#0069,ill fix that
Pizzanat#6176,Also I am gonna go back to sleep for another 30 minutes
Pizzanat#6176,Also food
Pizzanat#6176,Also i dunno
Pizzanat#6176,:D
karthiccc#0069,nice
BlazeThief#4311,Jasper your nose be good lad
Pizzanat#6176,no i died
BlazeThief#4311,Also good luck with the test lads
Pizzanat#6176,Also I forgot to say: I might not join still since ME MUM SLEEPIN STILL AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
BlazeThief#4311,just go like
BlazeThief#4311,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
BlazeThief#4311,Then she wont be sleeping
Pizzanat#6176,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THATS A GOOD IDEA
Pizzanat#6176,BUT I DUNNO AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
BlazeThief#4311,Would your mom be super mad if she woke up by you talking or something?
Pizzanat#6176,i dunno
BlazeThief#4311,Wackness
BlazeThief#4311,Great picture of yourself Jake
J-Klar#4158,:(
Aho#7784,Toxic Merak
Aho#7784,jeez
Pizzanat#6176,i like the musiccccccccccccc
Pizzanat#6176,hah
karthiccc#0069,jasper first question?
Pizzanat#6176,i got 0.027 m
Pizzanat#6176,or 2.7 cm
Pizzanat#6176,its weird but the example in the note is 7.3 cm so its weird i dunno
Lucаs#7263,and u dont use D
Pizzanat#6176,i didn''t
Pizzanat#6176,what have you guys got?
Lucаs#7263,the same
karthiccc#0069,JASPER
karthiccc#0069,what you think?
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat u get single or doubvle
Lucаs#7263,q4
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat
Pizzanat#6176,single
Lucаs#7263,thats what everyone said
Lucаs#7263,but KARTHIK
Pizzanat#6176,KARTHIK YOU SHOULD'VE HAD MORE SLEEP
BlazeThief#4311,The oracle of the new world himself
karthiccc#0069,7.3x10^-6 right jasper?
Pizzanat#6176,i have 1.1x10^-4 m
Lucаs#7263,for q4?
Pizzanat#6176,what about everyone else?
Pizzanat#6176,yes
karthiccc#0069,everyone else has 7.3
karthiccc#0069,jasper you used meters right
Aho#7784,what did you get for Y?
karthiccc#0069,and y/L = lambda/w
Pizzanat#6176,did you use bright spots or dark spots?
Aho#7784,dark
Pizzanat#6176,i used bright
Pizzanat#6176,so i did 3lamdaY/2y
karthiccc#0069,jasper it doesnt matter if its dark or bright spots you use
Aho#7784,Jasper what did you get for your y value?
Pizzanat#6176,0.02 m
Pizzanat#6176,i was about to ask for formula but we used different methods
karthiccc#0069,jasper you used the dark spot but used the bright spot formua
karthiccc#0069,because at 2.0cm its dark
Lucаs#7263,try dark me boi
Pizzanat#6176,i dunno i'mma look at it more after everything else
Pizzanat#6176,ok yeah its 7.3
karthiccc#0069,ight
karthiccc#0069,jasper you do 5?
karthiccc#0069,i got 0.22m as width diff
Pizzanat#6176,i dunno why but looking at a graph messed me up D:
Pizzanat#6176,and not yet
karthiccc#0069,ye messed us all up
Lucаs#7263,let us know what u vibin with J man fo numba 5
Pizzanat#6176,yeah i got 0.21 m
Pizzanat#6176,basically the same since i just rounded up more
Pizzanat#6176,actually i get 0.21 even without rounding hah
Pizzanat#6176,i rounded better
karthiccc#0069,ight jasper you done 7?
Pizzanat#6176,not yet
Lucаs#7263,wat fo q6
Pizzanat#6176,245.1 lines/cm
karthiccc#0069,244.58 lines/cm for me
Pizzanat#6176,i have 82 nm
Pizzanat#6176,so 8.2 x 10^-8 m
Pizzanat#6176,and 6 is probably just rounding then
karthiccc#0069,ight jasper join call sexy
karthiccc#0069,so we can discuss my poor life decisisons
Pizzanat#6176,Pinned a message.

Lucаs#7263,with slightly higher oddsprobably
Lucаs#7263,If you invest like $100 into a bunch of stocks you think might go up you might hit the jackpot
Lucаs#7263,a much more reliable way to get rich is to just marry into wealth
karthiccc#0069,nah this time it wasnt lottery like
karthiccc#0069,this was coordinated by people to happen
karthiccc#0069,legit market manipulation at its finest
karthiccc#0069,but only this time by people and not companies
J-Klar#4158,^
J-Klar#4158,And now the rich fuckers are crying about it despite them doing it for years

Lucаs#7263,see what I mean
Lucаs#7263,that should give me the right answer
Lucаs#7263,or wait
Lucаs#7263,i made mistake
karthiccc#0069,now do your V divided by speed of light
J-Klar#4158,the hell
J-Klar#4158,u made that a lot more complicated than it needed to be
J-Klar#4158,he had an example of using it to solve for v
J-Klar#4158,coulda just copied that
Lucаs#7263,i just isolated for V
Lucаs#7263,algerbra
J-Klar#4158,yeah u got power 4 roots tho

Lucаs#7263,yeah i feel youre pain
Lucаs#7263,2 weeks away from being able to trade and this shit happens
Lucаs#7263,i dont get why they dont just coordinate things like this over and over though
Lucаs#7263,"""like legit just find stocks that are highly shorted"
Lucаs#7263,make us all millionaires
karthiccc#0069,People are inconsistent
karthiccc#0069,Legit they could have kept gme at great heights if people followed what they were told
karthiccc#0069,And hold
karthiccc#0069,But nah people get greedy and scared and do what they think is good
karthiccc#0069,They could coordinate this again but heres the thing people will be split on what stock to do
karthiccc#0069,"""Like when gme was going big people teied to pump other stocks too such as NAKD"
karthiccc#0069,The thing was because people were split they couldnt drive ip the prices that high
karthiccc#0069,Can't coordinate something like this ever again or at least to the same degree
Lucаs#7263,bruh just have like a shit ton of kids and get them all to help u with this
Lucаs#7263,have ur bois in the hood drive up the price

Pizzanat#6176,hahhhhhhhhh
Aho#7784,I heard we dont even need  it

Aho#7784,that's the only thing we did last year
Aho#7784,I feel like
Pizzanat#6176,not really
Pizzanat#6176,we did more than that
Pizzanat#6176,so i guess we all forgot stuff in his class! :D
Aho#7784,just learn how to convert something into moles into another unit

Lucаs#7263,u use it for regular elearning but it is just so complicated
Pizzanat#6176,:(
Lucаs#7263,makes everytihng harder to access
Pizzanat#6176,Maybe we should start a class petition and force him to use google classroom and meets
Pizzanat#6176,Say we all get anxiety from that site and it will greatly affect how we learn
Lucаs#7263,im down
Aho#7784,wait how do I know if Chem is my course 1 or 2 course?

Aho#7784,oh okok
J-Klar#4158,Just choose it based on other stuff tbh
J-Klar#4158,like all of these unis are still really good and it's not gonna make that huge of a difference unless you're literally going to mit harvard oxford etc

Aho#7784,Chuc mung nam moi
Pizzanat#6176,ox
Pizzanat#6176,also i don't know vietnamese D:
Aho#7784,You could tell what that means tho
Pizzanat#6176,probably
Pizzanat#6176,does your family celebrate it?
BlazeThief#4311,You want to kill every person hear with a rusty skewer?
BlazeThief#4311,Damn
Aho#7784,We just say happy new year and get new year money
Pizzanat#6176,yeeee
Pizzanat#6176,nice
Pizzanat#6176,this year i gave money too
Pizzanat#6176,so net gain of 0
Pizzanat#6176,:D
Aho#7784,So I basically just say Chuc  mung nam moi
Aho#7784,On repeat
Aho#7784,And get 5-20 dollars everything
karthiccc#0069,I said it to my parents
Aho#7784,Said what?
karthiccc#0069,They said im not allowed to throw shit
Aho#7784,You probably butcher it too
karthiccc#0069,Well it means something completely different in my language
Aho#7784,Why not lol?
karthiccc#0069,And yes probably butchered it too
Aho#7784,WAIT WHAT?
karthiccc#0069,"""It means """"throw my shit son"""""""
karthiccc#0069,Closely resembles it
Aho#7784,That’s actually hilarious
karthiccc#0069,You can replace the word son with butter
karthiccc#0069,And it'll be around the same pronunciation
Aho#7784,Maybe
karthiccc#0069,But yeah happy new year to you too jordy
karthiccc#0069,Get rich!
Aho#7784,Probably will only get 60 dollars that I might have to give away to my cousins lol
karthiccc#0069,You win some and you lose some
karthiccc#0069,But just know
karthiccc#0069,That the 60 dollars coule've been over $70 if you invested it
karthiccc#0069,Just keep that in mind
Lucаs#7263,yes me boi
J-Klar#4158,I just came second in a game of ranked tft and got 226 lp lmao
Lucаs#7263,Wot
Aho#7784,Yeah they did that
Aho#7784,I think the reason why is just extremely dumb
Aho#7784,But yeah
J-Klar#4158,March break; April
J-Klar#4158,n1
J-Klar#4158,morons
J-Klar#4158,yeah youll delay march break but you'll keep schools open
J-Klar#4158,that have proven to spread covid
Aho#7784,Exactly
Aho#7784,I see no point
BlazeThief#4311,Wait
BlazeThief#4311,How will this help stop spread?
BlazeThief#4311,Is it cause they thinking peeps are going to just vibe and do stuff during the break?
J-Klar#4158,merak
Aho#7784,They just postponed the break cuz they’re afraid of another outbreak
Aho#7784,But this is only a school break so I see no point in this because not everyone will be off
maximumeffort1#3058,What a bunch of tools
karthiccc#0069,at least tools are useful
karthiccc#0069,these imbeciles are as useless as cutting a stone with a butter knife
BlazeThief#4311,Speaking truth
BlazeThief#4311,Although I ain't even going back so I just sitting here
Lucаs#7263,Like what is their whole idea
Lucаs#7263,“If people have a weeklong break they gonna go out and catch virus
Lucаs#7263,What do u think they doing this long weekend
Aho#7784,They’re trying to open everything up in summer and they don’t want families going on vacation to make it worst in March
Aho#7784,But I don’t think much will happen within a month time
Aho#7784,And it’s legit a week where the boarders are closed and nowhere to travel too so I don’t see a point in going on vacation
Lucаs#7263,I think if u gotta postpone the break schools should not be open
Aho#7784,Yeah ik
Lucаs#7263,Like what’s gonna happen when everyone goes on vacation in April
Lucаs#7263,What’s the point of moving it
Aho#7784,They’re just scared of another outbreak like they saw over winter break
Pizzanat#6176,Just keep march break and lockdown ez
Aho#7784,Yep
Aho#7784,I also don’t get why they open up school again at this time too
Pizzanat#6176,Probably mainly because things are slowly getting better and the province is hugely prioritizing having schools open because better for education
Aho#7784,But I see no difference between online and in class
Pizzanat#6176,Also because elementary school online is probably poopy (but in person is also scary)
Aho#7784,They’re mainly teaching for the online people anyways
maximumeffort1#3058,I hate the government
Lucаs#7263,I agree but what is your reasoning sire
Lucаs#7263,Just about the skool ting
maximumeffort1#3058,They’ve just been making a ton of dumb mistakes really
maximumeffort1#3058,"""Mr dougie Ford was doing good at the start of all the COVID stuff"
karthiccc#0069,Boys people still down to try volorante?
maximumeffort1#3058,Oooh we gaming valorant
karthiccc#0069,i mean im down to try it again if more people are
Aho#7784,I mean I can’t
maximumeffort1#3058,okay im down to game whenever
BlazeThief#4311,When you think you can get your monitors back jordan
BlazeThief#4311,You said march break but that now april break
BlazeThief#4311,Also bruv
BlazeThief#4311,I loaded the game up again
BlazeThief#4311,and they have a your shop equivalent
BlazeThief#4311,Why in the world are singular knife skins 30 dollars
Lucаs#7263,spensive
Lucаs#7263,just dont buy skins
Lucаs#7263,but not even really
Lucаs#7263,csgo knives are like 50-60
Lucаs#7263,but u can always resell so i guess its different
BlazeThief#4311,I didnt want to buy any was just curious of prices and what makes them so expensive even?
BlazeThief#4311,Like the csgo ones are rare from crates so it makes more sense
Lucаs#7263,Everything for that game is expensive even the lowest tier of skins is 7USD
Lucаs#7263,Considering you could get a few decent skins in CD from that
Lucаs#7263,It’s just like league merak
Lucаs#7263,knives are just considered to be high tier items
BlazeThief#4311,Even in league though they have worth for higher price skins
BlazeThief#4311,legit for the same price as a knife you get a skin that changes everything visually almost for the character
Lucаs#7263,thats how they see knife skins
Lucаs#7263,you get it for every character
Lucаs#7263,you never have to buy it always got it
Lucаs#7263,like buy it in game I mean
J-Klar#4158,I'll try it if yall do
BlazeThief#4311,Might not play today cause I gotta finish some stuff up
BlazeThief#4311,but on the weekend would

J-Klar#4158,ill be real I pretty much seem to always get the same thing
BlazeThief#4311,Puts different answers in every time lol
Lucаs#7263,i did it today and a few other times maybea month or a few weeks ago
Pizzanat#6176,does it have different questions each time or something?
J-Klar#4158,i dont thbink
J-Klar#4158,no
J-Klar#4158,so
Pizzanat#6176,how do you remember it all?
BlazeThief#4311,Its how you feel jasper
BlazeThief#4311,not how you remember
J-Klar#4158,thats the issue with these tests
J-Klar#4158,if you do them in different moods
J-Klar#4158,you probablky will get different answers
Lucаs#7263,idk i think intp is most like me
Lucаs#7263,i read the description a while ago
Pizzanat#6176,so if you are in a very disagreeing mood then it would change it a lot
Lucаs#7263,and relate big time
J-Klar#4158,i wonder what you get if u put everything in the middle
Pizzanat#6176,disagreeing person
Pizzanat#6176,so its jordan but with a watch
Lucаs#7263,did you just disagree everything
Pizzanat#6176,yes
Pizzanat#6176,now we agree with everything! hahhhhhh
Pizzanat#6176,it'll probably be more interesting to do middle everything though
Pizzanat#6176,so i'll do it after unless jake is already doing it
J-Klar#4158,Completely nuteral
J-Klar#4158,oddly not actually
Lucаs#7263,nah

J-Klar#4158,but i put grey dot for everything
J-Klar#4158,so
Pizzanat#6176,and you get a cake man if you agree with everything
J-Klar#4158,alright enough with the unimportant personality tests and lets get to the real stuf
J-Klar#4158,Ok I can't answer the first question
J-Klar#4158,This test is anti sad people

Lucаs#7263,As a ranged vs melee matchup
Lucаs#7263,Wildy different than a 2v2 in the bot lane
J-Klar#4158,are you
J-Klar#4158,bruh
Lucаs#7263,Id say 99% of people complaining about adcs are prob not playing them top
J-Klar#4158,I was talking about how people complain that adcs just lose against fighters and assassins
Lucаs#7263,Anyone saying fighters is just bad for sure
Lucаs#7263,Assassins are a different story. They got gap close and dmg
Lucаs#7263,Fighters like Darius has no gap close and less dmg
Lucаs#7263,In terms of burst
J-Klar#4158,true but at the same time adcs never really itemize against assassins
Lucаs#7263,I mean can they really?
J-Klar#4158,dude just buying stop watch is insane
J-Klar#4158,no one does it at mid low elo
Lucаs#7263,IG but that is kinda team reliant
J-Klar#4158,what do you mean?
Lucаs#7263,"""If assassin jumps on u and I stopwatch"
J-Klar#4158,i meant in sidelane
Lucаs#7263,Ou how that work at all
Lucаs#7263,The assassin just leaves
Lucаs#7263,And does it again
J-Klar#4158,after game
J-Klar#4158,i explain
Lucаs#7263,Bruh the stopwatch gonna be broken when the assassin just gotta wait 10 secs for abilities
J-Klar#4158,because you stop watch all their burst flash away then just kill them lol
J-Klar#4158,its an assassin
J-Klar#4158,they have no defence if it takes you 10 seconds to kill them
J-Klar#4158,idk whats going on
J-Klar#4158,The name Queen of Boobies is available right now
J-Klar#4158,so
Lucаs#7263,Then they flash away…
Lucаs#7263,Plus them walking away as soon as you stopwatch would be enough distance
J-Klar#4158,eh most adcs still have mobility
Lucаs#7263,I guess it depends some assassins have more mobility
J-Klar#4158,you would also be dodging their ults
J-Klar#4158,then you have that adv
J-Klar#4158,bruh I can never think of a username
Lucаs#7263,600g
J-Klar#4158,i actually hate trying to think of one
J-Klar#4158,toward your GA yes

Aho#7784,like fiora and irelia can they not?
Lucаs#7263,Yeah that ur gonna build after ur core
Aho#7784,and stride also helps the immobile
J-Klar#4158,i mean you wouldn't be sidelaning before 3 items when you think about it
J-Klar#4158,usernames help me think
J-Klar#4158,i could sit for like 4 hours and never make one
J-Klar#4158,it hurts

BlazeThief#4311,Thats why I work somewhere safe
Pizzanat#6176,Are you kidding? No where is safe! Your roof could fall down on you any minute!
Pizzanat#6176,"""It was no accident"
karthiccc#0069,exactly what jasper said
karthiccc#0069,a 10 foot metal rod could come flying through your window and straight up your nose
karthiccc#0069,"""it was no accident"
BlazeThief#4311,Damn might aswell kill myself first then

BlazeThief#4311,I guess
BlazeThief#4311,New killer ability interesting
BlazeThief#4311,he just throws knives at you
BlazeThief#4311,and he has to throw enough to fill a bar or something and then it makes your state go down

BlazeThief#4311,Someone got into my ea account and cheated in apex legends
BlazeThief#4311,Apparently it isn't too uncommon since other people have had it happen
BlazeThief#4311,But pretty much I am banned on it
BlazeThief#4311,and cannot unlink it from steam cause of that
Aho#7784,Oh
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah other people who had it said you have to spam them with support tickets before they check ips
BlazeThief#4311,I just sent one and that one January 23 I think
BlazeThief#4311,So they took a whole month just to not help me at all
Aho#7784,Well it’s only Apex
Aho#7784,You didn’t spend money right??
BlazeThief#4311,Nah but I can never play on steam with my other account until it's unbanned

Lucаs#7263,just spam them with tickets
Lucаs#7263,actually wack how they dont unlink from steam tho
Lucаs#7263,it doesnty make a difference to them

karthiccc#0069,whoever wrote that is down bad
BlazeThief#4311,Was actually Karthik on his alt
karthiccc#0069,didn't have to expose me like that
BlazeThief#4311,My bad I'll post my concept on my alt then we will be chill
karthiccc#0069,the law of equivalent exchange
Lucаs#7263,Merak’s concept is just a new skinline
Lucаs#7263,Nude character skinline but only for ezreal and kayn
Lucаs#7263,And of course
Lucаs#7263,Gragas
karthiccc#0069,can't really complain when he includes gragas too
J-Klar#4158,lmao bandaged discord turned gragas into an emote
karthiccc#0069,Bandaged?
J-Klar#4158,ye better discord
J-Klar#4158,Boys should I bother doing this test thing for Waterloo
J-Klar#4158,Considering I suck at them
J-Klar#4158,I feel like its just a waste
Aho#7784,if it give you a better chance to get in then why not go for it
Aho#7784,not hurting anything
J-Klar#4158,because I don't think I would get in either way
Aho#7784,doesnt hurt to try
J-Klar#4158,and I don't really want to take time out of my day to do one
J-Klar#4158,and all the test anxiety
J-Klar#4158,and for some reason i have to pay them my hard earned money
J-Klar#4158,feels like a scam
Aho#7784,lol whatever you say
J-Klar#4158,i dont see why i should bother if Im not going to get a result anyway
J-Klar#4158,also I doubt they would give me as much money to go there than other schools
Aho#7784,you never know unless you try
J-Klar#4158,I don't know about that. I've never tried to get pregnant but I'm highly suspicious of it working out
Aho#7784,well as long as you have no regrets later on then you can do whatever you like
J-Klar#4158,Considering it won't have an impact on employ-ability I don't really care and would rather go somewhere that gives me more moolah
J-Klar#4158,university expensive man
Aho#7784,true true
Aho#7784,that's why I might look into going to guelph instead of ryerson if Mcmaster or waterloo does not accept me
J-Klar#4158,I'm sure if you got into Ryerson you'd get into Waterloo
J-Klar#4158,Then again I don't really know much about engineering
J-Klar#4158,Like who designed this. What is this....
J-Klar#4158,Why is there one day of course 1
J-Klar#4158,then 2 of 2
J-Klar#4158,then 2 of 1
J-Klar#4158,what were they smoking
J-Klar#4158,holy
Lucаs#7263,Jake
Lucаs#7263,The way I look at it is
Lucаs#7263,You spent $50 on it basically so may as well make it worth
Lucаs#7263,The Waterloo application that is
J-Klar#4158,yeah cuz I had to
J-Klar#4158,I didn't even want to apply to 3
J-Klar#4158,I don't really care about going there
J-Klar#4158,especially because it will be more expensive
J-Klar#4158,for really nothing more
J-Klar#4158,so
J-Klar#4158,no
karthiccc#0069,waterloo really does value their tests and honestly participation in general is already putting you a step ahead of those who don't
karthiccc#0069,so i mean
karthiccc#0069,"""do as you wish but if you care"
karthiccc#0069,otherwise don't
J-Klar#4158,Yeah im aware that if I don't do it I wont get in
J-Klar#4158,But im also realistic in knowning that my math grades and my result on that test will also not help me get in
J-Klar#4158,so I don't really see a point
Lucаs#7263,50 bucks is 50 bucks
Lucаs#7263,Shoulda just applied to different programs u may have been interested in
Lucаs#7263,But I guess if u won’t go there anyways then meh
J-Klar#4158,i wasn't really interested in anything else
J-Klar#4158,also didn't even know that was a thing tbh
J-Klar#4158,i thought everyone just applied for the same program
J-Klar#4158,oh grad quotes are due today

Lucаs#7263,Bois
Lucаs#7263,If I get new phone do I get android or iPhone
Lucаs#7263,And what plans do u guys have
Lucаs#7263,I was actually thinking about getting a flip phone
J-Klar#4158,dude I wish I could just not have a plan
J-Klar#4158,literally the only calls I get on my phone are scam calls
J-Klar#4158,i just want data
J-Klar#4158,no texts
J-Klar#4158,no minutes
J-Klar#4158,just data
J-Klar#4158,and i dont even need muhc
J-Klar#4158,cuz i dont go outside
J-Klar#4158,honestly lucas it doesn't really matter
J-Klar#4158,android phones would be cheaper im guessing tho
J-Klar#4158,i would just go with whatever has the best looks
J-Klar#4158,spec wise everything is like the same
karthiccc#0069,I got freedom mobile
karthiccc#0069,30$ a month
karthiccc#0069,Unlimited data + text + call
karthiccc#0069,Really good but its unreliable in certain areas
karthiccc#0069,Not sure if they still have the offer
karthiccc#0069,But they generally are good on prices
karthiccc#0069,Also for phones android are just as expensive as iphone if you are looking for similar spec models
karthiccc#0069,Whichever cheaper is better
Lucаs#7263,"""I’m thinking just keeping my phone and getting a cheap plan like that karthik but for $45 I could upgrade my phone and have unlimited call"
Lucаs#7263,But then at the same time flip phones be baller
Lucаs#7263,No Instagram just calls and texts
Lucаs#7263,But the $45 is a 2 year contract so over those 2 years 15x24 = lotta money
Lucаs#7263,Rather than just getting something like urs
Lucаs#7263,But if I get a new phone I could sell mine right now and offset some of that extra cost
Lucаs#7263,This is the dilemma
Lucаs#7263,Plus the new phone would be worth more at the end of 2 years
J-Klar#4158,Just get a pager
J-Klar#4158,ez
karthiccc#0069,ok lucas I got the best solution for you
karthiccc#0069,buy a pigeon
karthiccc#0069,solved all your problems
J-Klar#4158,Just become a hermit
J-Klar#4158,then you wont need anything
J-Klar#4158,cuz you just dont communicate
karthiccc#0069,i mean lucas do you have any complaints with your phone?
karthiccc#0069,if not then don't change it
karthiccc#0069,if it works why replace it?
J-Klar#4158,truers
maximumeffort1#3058,"""I got freedom too"
maximumeffort1#3058,And yes also what karthik said if it works why replace it
maximumeffort1#3058,But if it’s broken get a new one
J-Klar#4158,I literally hate team games
J-Klar#4158,so stupid
J-Klar#4158,literally no one knows how to fucking play the game
J-Klar#4158,im perma pinging this mundo to come break this freeze
J-Klar#4158,and the fucking idiot is just moronic
J-Klar#4158,brainlet monkey
J-Klar#4158,not hard to understand wave states

J-Klar#4158,ooga
J-Klar#4158,i play mundo jungle
J-Klar#4158,ooga

karthiccc#0069,ight boys
karthiccc#0069,got into software engineering at waterloo
J-Klar#4158,wut is that
Lucаs#7263,Nice one G
BlazeThief#4311,Congrats baller mans
Pizzanat#6176,wooooooooooo! now you can make a nicer looking quest page for waterloo! :D
Aho#7784,Karthik how do you check if you got accepted or not?
J-Klar#4158,don't they just email you
J-Klar#4158,or send you mail
karthiccc#0069,go to quest and then go to admissions
karthiccc#0069,should show up there
karthiccc#0069,now click the program
Aho#7784,Nothing yet huh?
karthiccc#0069,if you get an offer it'll come under status as conditional admit
J-Klar#4158,Karthik is software engineering just cs or is it different
J-Klar#4158,because hyper pog u if thats just their name for cs and just a little less hyper pog u if its not
J-Klar#4158,but overall hyper pog u game
J-Klar#4158,r
J-Klar#4158,get u some
karthiccc#0069,it is cs but a little more advanced
karthiccc#0069,and thank you my G
J-Klar#4158,If you get into cs do you think you would do that or this
karthiccc#0069,im def gonna go for this
karthiccc#0069,i can drop down to cs if I want to
karthiccc#0069,later on if it gets too hard
J-Klar#4158,Poggies
J-Klar#4158,I'm just gonna wait to see whoever gives the most moola
karthiccc#0069,what you mean by that?
J-Klar#4158,Whichever school gives me the most money
karthiccc#0069,oh scholarships and that right?
J-Klar#4158,Yup
karthiccc#0069,ye that would be real nice
J-Klar#4158,Laurier and Guelph have different systems as far as U can tell though
J-Klar#4158,I think Guelph gave enough to nearly cover the first year but Laurier gives more for the additional years
Aho#7784,Guelph hhas a better environment appreantly
karthiccc#0069,ye guelph seems to just give a big wad of cash right away
J-Klar#4158,That's what I've heard
karthiccc#0069,i've heard the same for guelph
J-Klar#4158,Heard that Guelph campus nicer
karthiccc#0069,much nicer
karthiccc#0069,its really good
J-Klar#4158,And apparently it's closer
J-Klar#4158,Or at least the traffic isn't as bad
karthiccc#0069,yeah its like what 20 mins away?
J-Klar#4158,So I'll probably go there
J-Klar#4158,Like 70% rn
karthiccc#0069,for which program jake?
J-Klar#4158,Cs
J-Klar#4158,I only applied to cs
karthiccc#0069,i have a friend who's a 3rd year at guelph
karthiccc#0069,he seems to like it a lot
karthiccc#0069,def better than laurier from what i've heard
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
J-Klar#4158,Hype
J-Klar#4158,We won't be neighbour's tho
J-Klar#4158,So it might have to be a pass
karthiccc#0069,lmao true
karthiccc#0069,but its not like imma live near waterloo or anything
Aho#7784,I might go guelph
karthiccc#0069,we basically are neighbours
J-Klar#4158,well i meant schools
karthiccc#0069,well yeah tru
J-Klar#4158,yeah they giving me 7500 big ones
karthiccc#0069,oooooh very nice
J-Klar#4158,so that will help a lot
karthiccc#0069,yeah guelph is very nice when it comes to entrance scholarships
karthiccc#0069,thats for sure
J-Klar#4158,yup and if i just get good grades ill get money for following years too
Aho#7784,my cousin also said that its very nice for Student entertainment
karthiccc#0069,oh they give more over the years too?
karthiccc#0069,thought it was a one time thing
karthiccc#0069,cuz i got an entrance scholarship for a good amount but didn't think they would add onto it over the years
J-Klar#4158,idk laurier offered it to me
J-Klar#4158,so maybe guelph does it
karthiccc#0069,guess you'll get more info when time gets closer
karthiccc#0069,but god damn all these emails for residence is pissing me off
J-Klar#4158,i havent gotten any for residence
J-Klar#4158,?
karthiccc#0069,wait really?
J-Klar#4158,did you mention you were thinking about it somewhere
J-Klar#4158,maybe thats why
karthiccc#0069,no not at all
karthiccc#0069,"""but every single place is sending emails saying """"deadline for residance shit is coming"""""""
J-Klar#4158,oof yeah guelph gives a much higher entrance than laurier
J-Klar#4158,and considering for me the first year would be the hardest to pay (i can get a job soon once i get permanent residency) it loks like the play
J-Klar#4158,lol git gud
karthiccc#0069,so guelph is the gamer?
J-Klar#4158,it seems
karthiccc#0069,poggers
J-Klar#4158,"""its closer"
karthiccc#0069,ye compared to laurier it is better
J-Klar#4158,and you know for a fact your boy aint fucking living in no residence
J-Klar#4158,we home boys
J-Klar#4158,yar yar
karthiccc#0069,don't know about busing tho

J-Klar#4158,Ye but dw i would do bad
Aho#7784,maybe if we have simular schedule
J-Klar#4158,"""""""You're not a number. You're a Gryphon. Going to university isn't just about getting a degree or a job. (Although yes"
Aho#7784,I get a scholarship for Ryerson tho

Aho#7784,It does
J-Klar#4158,you're doing electrical engineering right?
J-Klar#4158,idk i changed a light bulb so i think i have the authority
J-Klar#4158,on the situation
karthiccc#0069,i can turn on and off a switch so i have the authority to debate

Aho#7784,but Im doing computer engineering for Guelph
J-Klar#4158,o?
Aho#7784,Guelph didnt have a Electrical so I opted for my second pick of engineering which is Computer
J-Klar#4158,fair enough
J-Klar#4158,but if you want to do electrical you should go ryerson
J-Klar#4158,regrets are lame

J-Klar#4158,Ah yes Morgana has the fastest initial clear in the game
J-Klar#4158,Just in front of Darius....
J-Klar#4158,Huh Darius can solo drag at level 1... without smite
BlazeThief#4311,Pso2 new genesis
BlazeThief#4311,I want to try monkey coffee
J-Klar#4158,I dont know why but this the first thing about cancer that has ever really like hit me. I don't know who this is or anything but just imagine being given 2 weeks to live and knowing the end is coming. 
Pizzanat#6176,sadness
J-Klar#4158,i dont really want to know if you're referring to a mans last twitter post before dying of cancer after losing his leg or that your dodgeball game costs $20
Pizzanat#6176,both
J-Klar#4158,yeah i guess that works
maximumeffort1#3058,Damn Jake that makes me more depressed than I already am
karthiccc#0069,I want to make a breaking bad joke but it really is not appropriate
karthiccc#0069,but damn... honestly that is just sad
karthiccc#0069,if it was me
karthiccc#0069,i would just regret everything I did
karthiccc#0069,why spend this much time in school
karthiccc#0069,so much time playing video games
karthiccc#0069,could have done other things more worth while
maximumeffort1#3058,I don’t think I’m content with anything I’ve done in my life
maximumeffort1#3058,All the regret is catching up to me and I hate it
BlazeThief#4311,All we've really done is go to school
karthiccc#0069,exactly
BlazeThief#4311,And it's kinda crummy
karthiccc#0069,literally all of your youth is spent at school
BlazeThief#4311,Since we barely figure out what you like
karthiccc#0069,such a waste
BlazeThief#4311,and are then sauced to another school
BlazeThief#4311,To then decide your entire life
karthiccc#0069,its wack man thats for sure
BlazeThief#4311,We legit spend 1/4 of our life in school
BlazeThief#4311,Some even shorter
karthiccc#0069,yeah literally
BlazeThief#4311,Imagine being told you had cancer and 2 weeks to live
BlazeThief#4311,I would be so pissed
BlazeThief#4311,All of this school is for nothing
karthiccc#0069,but then again you wouldn't meet too many people if it werent for school
karthiccc#0069,this server wouldn't exist if it werent for it
BlazeThief#4311,Wouldn't matter if you died in 2 weeks anyway
karthiccc#0069,thats true
BlazeThief#4311,Though the time before that would be better spent with the lads
karthiccc#0069,thats true
karthiccc#0069,school should just be socializing
karthiccc#0069,not education
karthiccc#0069,education can come with whatever job you wanna try for
BlazeThief#4311,I'd say learning stuff like english and math kinda good thou
BlazeThief#4311,Kinda necessary
karthiccc#0069,eh id say math to the extent of maybe grade 8 where its all just basics
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
karthiccc#0069,past that is wack
karthiccc#0069,"""same with english"
BlazeThief#4311,Past that its if you want to go into it
BlazeThief#4311,Thats why science hella wack
karthiccc#0069,cuz whats the difference between grade 9- 12 english?
BlazeThief#4311,If I don't want to do science related tings
BlazeThief#4311,why am I forced to take 2 science courses
karthiccc#0069,"""ok I get the """"you never know unless you try"""" aspect of it"""
BlazeThief#4311,But isn't that kinda middle school
karthiccc#0069,but semester should be enough
BlazeThief#4311,you just try everything
karthiccc#0069,eh middle school you can't really try the real science parts
BlazeThief#4311,Though I can see wanting a high school version instead
BlazeThief#4311,Cause middle school kinda sketch
karthiccc#0069,just the very very basic level stuff
karthiccc#0069,ye exactly
karthiccc#0069,"""but I do think that they should have separated science into chem"
karthiccc#0069,then in highschool you can choose as soon as you get in
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,Its all just wack
BlazeThief#4311,And probably wont change ever or if it does is a long long time off
karthiccc#0069,last time it changed was 20+ years ago
BlazeThief#4311,Damn get the dev
BlazeThief#4311,s
karthiccc#0069,change probably takes a shit ton of time on its own and money to change
BlazeThief#4311,Patches be too slow
karthiccc#0069,cuz textbooks
karthiccc#0069,honestly the company wack
karthiccc#0069,lets cancel them
BlazeThief#4311,lol
BlazeThief#4311,Though everything is starting to move online
BlazeThief#4311,So maybe it can mean change eventually
karthiccc#0069,honestly yeah thats true
karthiccc#0069,if a lot of it goes online
karthiccc#0069,they can change faster
karthiccc#0069,"""also i realized that if they changed how school works"
karthiccc#0069,at least with the way they are doing it now they know some kids are getting jobs in the future
karthiccc#0069,n stuff
BlazeThief#4311,Dang
BlazeThief#4311,That could be kinda oof then
karthiccc#0069,ye
BlazeThief#4311,And if it goes online abunch
BlazeThief#4311,could ruin social skills and stuff more
BlazeThief#4311,Like look at me
BlazeThief#4311,Legit missed years of school
karthiccc#0069,yeah but at least you have friends
BlazeThief#4311,Truth
karthiccc#0069,but you are completely right
karthiccc#0069,some people could go fully introverted
karthiccc#0069,and not socialize at all
karthiccc#0069,welp... at least we ain't gonna be apart of that
BlazeThief#4311,If any of us have kids they could be thou
karthiccc#0069,oh tru.....
karthiccc#0069,well sucks to be them
BlazeThief#4311,Forgot to write kids
BlazeThief#4311,Sucks to be the parent aswell
karthiccc#0069,man parenting seems a lil too hard
karthiccc#0069,i think id pass
BlazeThief#4311,lol
karthiccc#0069,i don't think i would trust myself with a living creature
BlazeThief#4311,Thats also right now
BlazeThief#4311,May vibe with it in like 10 years
karthiccc#0069,i guess I'll know then
karthiccc#0069,they do be saying birth rate gonna go down in the future
BlazeThief#4311,Apparently the world gonna be dead in like 30 years aswell
karthiccc#0069,wait what?
BlazeThief#4311,So looking a bit sketch
BlazeThief#4311,Probably not true
BlazeThief#4311,Just remember people saying that with out climate crum
karthiccc#0069,oooooh yeah true
BlazeThief#4311,We only have like 20 or 30 years before the earth just becomes bad
karthiccc#0069,yeah but even if its bad we can still survive
karthiccc#0069,pretty sure i read that give it a century or 2 and then survival won't even be possible
karthiccc#0069,"""but then again"
BlazeThief#4311,Imagine dying and then there is reincarnation
BlazeThief#4311,so you just get reborn there again
BlazeThief#4311,just to live in legit hell
karthiccc#0069,so this is hell after all
BlazeThief#4311,lol
karthiccc#0069,wouldn't be too surprised
BlazeThief#4311,Going there one way or another
karthiccc#0069,but like would you know you got reincarnated?
karthiccc#0069,thats the thing
BlazeThief#4311,Truew
BlazeThief#4311,we could be reincarnated rn
BlazeThief#4311,and not even know
karthiccc#0069,damn
karthiccc#0069,i hope not
karthiccc#0069,god damn
karthiccc#0069,living through this for multiple generations
karthiccc#0069,yeah that really is hell
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah hopefully if there reincarnation it pulls some anime level stuff
BlazeThief#4311,and chucks me into a fantasy world
BlazeThief#4311,no climate change
BlazeThief#4311,just vibe
BlazeThief#4311,and then die
karthiccc#0069,pretty sure even in fantasy worlds they have their own problems right
BlazeThief#4311,True
BlazeThief#4311,but don't think the earth legit being perished slowly
karthiccc#0069,i never got why in those world they didn't have dictators?
karthiccc#0069,like think about it
BlazeThief#4311,Thats what we become
karthiccc#0069,oh yeah true
karthiccc#0069,because we go into the world
karthiccc#0069,skills maxed out right?
karthiccc#0069,ez
BlazeThief#4311,lol
BlazeThief#4311,kirito
BlazeThief#4311,gaming
karthiccc#0069,you watched sao a long time ago right?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah ages ago
karthiccc#0069,wasn't it like trash?
BlazeThief#4311,I watched it when I first started watching crum
BlazeThief#4311,So I probably thought kirito was a chad
karthiccc#0069,but what you think of him now?
BlazeThief#4311,The newest seasons are pretty average I think
BlazeThief#4311,but from what I have seen animation was aight
BlazeThief#4311,Just pretty generic
BlazeThief#4311,Lad just busted
BlazeThief#4311,and wins
karthiccc#0069,ye i saw some fight scenes and they look ight
karthiccc#0069,nothing too special
BlazeThief#4311,Ye
BlazeThief#4311,Jujutsu Kaisen animation was just too good
karthiccc#0069,mappa did that right?
karthiccc#0069,or what studio was it ahain
BlazeThief#4311,ye
BlazeThief#4311,They doing Chainsawman
karthiccc#0069,yeah they absolute mad lads over there
BlazeThief#4311,Honestly
karthiccc#0069,bro i can't wait for chainsawman
karthiccc#0069,didn't the manga end?
BlazeThief#4311,Same
BlazeThief#4311,It ended but they making a part 2
karthiccc#0069,oh damn
karthiccc#0069,if the anime can cover the whole manga that'd be blessed
BlazeThief#4311,It like 90 chapters or something
karthiccc#0069,cuz im holdin off reading just so i can watch it without knowing
BlazeThief#4311,Forget how long it be
BlazeThief#4311,Chapter wise
karthiccc#0069,hmmmmm
BlazeThief#4311,Like how many pages in each
BlazeThief#4311,Wait for anime
karthiccc#0069,i mean they might be able to cram it all in 24 episodes?
karthiccc#0069,25 maybe?
BlazeThief#4311,Maybe
BlazeThief#4311,Wouldn't be surprised

Pizzanat#6176,so pls no vote me
karthiccc#0069,Alright
Pizzanat#6176,but if i am one of the four then there are probably more people than just on this server who put my name D:
karthiccc#0069,Yeah i was about to say
Pizzanat#6176,i will literally message guidance and say that i am not interested
karthiccc#0069,Yeah you should if you really are keen on not doing it
karthiccc#0069,But i will say it again
karthiccc#0069,Out of all of them... you are the most qualified imo
BlazeThief#4311,What so sketch about it?
BlazeThief#4311,Is it just like having to make a speech and stuffs
BlazeThief#4311,Cause that do be kinda wackness
karthiccc#0069,Yeah its mainly the speach
karthiccc#0069,You get an award too for it
karthiccc#0069,Looks good on resumes too
BlazeThief#4311,Thats what I be saying
Pizzanat#6176,"""those other three are much more active in terms of community and doing stuff for the school and stuff"
karthiccc#0069,Yeah but if you think about it
karthiccc#0069,They had to try to get into that kinda position
BlazeThief#4311,Are they more active in the community of gamers though
BlazeThief#4311,Not only that but Jasper is accepting of any kind of people weeb or not
karthiccc#0069,You didnt do anything but people considered you worthy
karthiccc#0069,Thats more impressive than needing to campaign and do other stuff
Pizzanat#6176,but what did i really do?
karthiccc#0069,Be a good person
BlazeThief#4311,What did they really do thou
karthiccc#0069,If there was an award for best human it be u
BlazeThief#4311,We kinda been wacked for the last 2 years of school aswell
Pizzanat#6176,"""volunteering"
karthiccc#0069,Yeah but who cares
karthiccc#0069,Its about who the people choose
karthiccc#0069,They had to work to get a vote
karthiccc#0069,U didnt
karthiccc#0069,By default that makes you outstanding
BlazeThief#4311,You are level 100 mafia boss
karthiccc#0069,^
BlazeThief#4311,And they are still level 50 crook even with the other stuff
karthiccc#0069,But again decision is yours
BlazeThief#4311,Or maybe higher but the pure gamer legend energy that emanates off of you bumps you up to the level of an ascended being
BlazeThief#4311,@SaggyNaggy What do you think
Pizzanat#6176,no
karthiccc#0069,If you really dont want it jasper just message guidance
SaggyNaggy#4306,I think you should do it
Pizzanat#6176,i'll message guidance
Pizzanat#6176,"""i'm grateful for all the support"
BlazeThief#4311,Making a speech seems wack though so I see you jasper
karthiccc#0069,I still feel his speach would be hilariously good
BlazeThief#4311,Jasper walks up onto stage and a spongebob ost starts playing
karthiccc#0069,Best day ever starts playing
BlazeThief#4311,He walks up and for the first time curses into the microphone and then just walks off
BlazeThief#4311,Would leave the whole room shocked
karthiccc#0069,I still await the day jasper says his first big boy word
BlazeThief#4311,Pray the day never comes
karthiccc#0069,I pray it comes sooner
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat i kinda wanna see how many people actually would vote for you
BlazeThief#4311,You could maybe see how many actually voted if you are going to get taken out of it
karthiccc#0069,Imagine jasper wins and they realise he doesnt wanna do it

J-Klar#4158,so sorry
BlazeThief#4311,Can't even remember the last time I played yas lol
BlazeThief#4311,They take the luck away
BlazeThief#4311,So they can put more into a sick kayn skin
BlazeThief#4311,And then a sick ezreal skin
J-Klar#4158,In their defence isn't based on frequency of play in a certain section of time
J-Klar#4158,you haven't exactly played all too much
BlazeThief#4311,True but when I have its been kayn kha and ez most likely
BlazeThief#4311,can't have kayn there
BlazeThief#4311,kha is
BlazeThief#4311,but ezreal no where to be seen

Lucаs#7263,"""Can confirm"
Lucаs#7263,They expanded it to contain every ezreal skin and gave me a discount becuase I already own battle acedemia ezreal so the total bundle was 0rp

J-Klar#4158,and i know you're cheap
J-Klar#4158,but you're likely not that cheap
J-Klar#4158,i would hope not at leasr
Lucаs#7263,I didn’t spend any effort it is literally afk
Lucаs#7263,So I don’t care set it overnight and yeah why would I pay like 8 bucks when I could just not
Lucаs#7263,You’ve severely underestimated the way of the jew
J-Klar#4158,apparently
J-Klar#4158,i feel like the power cost would supersede the cost of just buying one
J-Klar#4158,but that only applies if you're paying for electricity
J-Klar#4158,and i also might be completely wrong
J-Klar#4158,you got pretty close
J-Klar#4158,25
Lucаs#7263,Yeah I’m not paying for electrify and even if I was think about the dude that’s selling that account
Lucаs#7263,No way it’s going for a loss
J-Klar#4158,I'm  not enough of a jew I guess
Lucаs#7263,For real
Lucаs#7263,Mans don’t even got a yamaka
J-Klar#4158,I could send nudes to you and report you for cp
J-Klar#4158,And you'd get arrested
J-Klar#4158,And you can't do it back
J-Klar#4158,Noob
Lucаs#7263,lemme just sauce a quick screenshot\
BlazeThief#4311,Is that how it would even work though
BlazeThief#4311,Is just sending it enough or does he actually have to like save it and stuff for him to get arrested
Lucаs#7263,feel like u can definetly get arrested for that
BlazeThief#4311,Just for someone sending?
Lucаs#7263,picture some dude that just has his dms filled with that
BlazeThief#4311,True
Lucаs#7263,or even just a few cp is cp man
BlazeThief#4311,But like if some random dude just messaged you some
BlazeThief#4311,and you block them
Lucаs#7263,yeah that chill
Lucаs#7263,i would think
BlazeThief#4311,I guess if you just like c
BlazeThief#4311,hilling with it
BlazeThief#4311,like they send it
BlazeThief#4311,and you don't do anything it still bad
Lucаs#7263,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,Since you could legit just go back to the message and see it
Lucаs#7263,youd want to delete and block prob
BlazeThief#4311,Truth
BlazeThief#4311,So jake
BlazeThief#4311,its been real

BlazeThief#4311,That would make sense if he was a smurf
maximumeffort1#3058,Exactly
karthiccc#0069,why the fuck are ducky keyboards so expensive
karthiccc#0069,jesus christ
karthiccc#0069,lucas don't you have one?
J-Klar#4158,he got his for free remember
karthiccc#0069,ya ik and im remembering how bloody lucky he is
karthiccc#0069,"""also jake"
karthiccc#0069,no Logitech tho
Lucаs#7263,Ducky one 2 mini
karthiccc#0069,im very tempted
karthiccc#0069,$99usd on mechanicalkeyboards.com
karthiccc#0069,@Aho whats the keyboard you have again?
maximumeffort1#3058,Bruh the voice actor for toph is fucking dead
BlazeThief#4311,Just looked it up it's the Brazilian voice actress so not the one we heard I think
BlazeThief#4311,Still quite sad though
Lucаs#7263,I wouldn’t recommend the one 2 mini
Lucаs#7263,I love it and it’s a great keyboard especially for free but the macro functions are pretty bad and for me at least it’s kinda a big deal when the keyboard is so small
Lucаs#7263,There’s no software for it too it’s only thru preset keybinds and they are really clunky to use
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah ngl 60 percent is aight
BlazeThief#4311,But I would say the 10 keyless probably more baller
BlazeThief#4311,still get most of stuff and don't have to deal with cringe function keyt
karthiccc#0069,I dont get why but ten keyless is more expensive than normal sized...
Lucаs#7263,Especially for programming karthik 60% is hella annoying cuz you gotta use arrow keys more
BlazeThief#4311,Just buy a normal and cut off the numpad
Lucаs#7263,Why u even need a new one
karthiccc#0069,Just want somethin smaller
BlazeThief#4311,Actually the most sadge thing
Lucаs#7263,Thought u had a Ight one
BlazeThief#4311,when you use the function key for arrows
BlazeThief#4311,and then go to type and it keeps it on
Lucаs#7263,Ye that’s what I do
BlazeThief#4311,so you just did something wack
karthiccc#0069,It is ight but like takes up too much space
karthiccc#0069,Not like o ever use the numpad eother
Lucаs#7263,Like Karthik I had to make shift windows alt and ctrl my arrow keys
Lucаs#7263,It’s pretty wack
BlazeThief#4311,I just use base
BlazeThief#4311,Control windows alt and the ?/ key
Lucаs#7263,But don’t I have to press function before using those?
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,thats why its annoying
Lucаs#7263,Mine just act like regular arrowkeys
BlazeThief#4311,and leads to me using random things half the time
Lucаs#7263,Cuz I don’t really use those buttons often
BlazeThief#4311,True
karthiccc#0069,Tbh i wouldnt mind that setup lucas too much
Lucаs#7263,Idk mane it’s a little weird and my biggest gripe is no software u gotta enter like 7 different key code combinations just to set that up
Lucаs#7263,But if you don’t mind that maybe look at other 60%s but I feel like this one is not it
Lucаs#7263,Cuz other 60%s will have software
Lucаs#7263,Or just go back to membrane
BlazeThief#4311,I think the one jordan and I have has a software but its some sketch thing you download from google drive
BlazeThief#4311,I forget what it's called though so you'd have to ask jordan for the name
BlazeThief#4311,@J-Klar
J-Klar#4158,I honestly don't feel that way about the game
J-Klar#4158,Or atleast
J-Klar#4158,when playing killer
J-Klar#4158,I can see why survivors might feel that way
J-Klar#4158,because of rng
J-Klar#4158,but thats just the trade off of being the stronger roll i gues

Lucаs#7263,Not thru the tunnel but literally ripped open her stomach
Lucаs#7263,War book and these guys were hella wack
Lucаs#7263,The wack mans legit had containers with human body parts stored in them

maximumeffort1#3058,I hope it’s fiction
BlazeThief#4311,Worse stuff probably has happened
maximumeffort1#3058,My book is about a bunch of dude addicted to smoking crack and huffing glue
BlazeThief#4311,Apparently it takes inspiration from history
Lucаs#7263,Ye it’s similar to WW2
Lucаs#7263,Yeah I read up on it that’s just means WW2 I think
Lucаs#7263,It’s essentially the conflict of China and Japan during WW2
BlazeThief#4311,ohh

BlazeThief#4311,It does seem like a lot of work though
BlazeThief#4311,Would be sick for him if he could just yoink it and dip
Lucаs#7263,i think he mostly just felt like he wasnt involved as much as other people
Lucаs#7263,like other people planning and running events in leadership
BlazeThief#4311,Then why is 45 percent of the people voting him instead though
BlazeThief#4311,Gotta look at the facts jasper
Lucаs#7263,everyone loves jasper
Lucаs#7263,those the facts
Lucаs#7263,guess we not homies thenh

Aho#7784,I mean look the the min
Lucаs#7263,i always thought recomended was high settings 60fps and min was low 30fps
Lucаs#7263,so i guess it would kinda make sense

J-Klar#4158,apologize to both me and the function plz
J-Klar#4158,you have upset us
Lucаs#7263,@Pizzanat @karthiccc @Aho if y'all have started the HW for the first question #2 on 369 it says use second derivative test to find local max/min. Is that a typo or something? i thought we used first derivative for that and second for concavity?
J-Klar#4158,yeah thats weird
Pizzanat#6176,Ye it weird but first derivative is all you need
J-Klar#4158,Smile
Lucаs#7263,ight thanks g
Pizzanat#6176,I think it is meaning to say to use the second derivative to determine whether is it a concave up or down
Lucаs#7263,"""Find the critical points for each of the following"
Pizzanat#6176,And use what you know about it being concave up or down to find min or max
Pizzanat#6176,But that is also unnecessary work so textbook bad
J-Klar#4158,sad or happy is the correct terminoligy
maximumeffort1#3058,anyone up for some gaypex?
karthiccc#0069,can your wifi handle it now?

Lucаs#7263,Yessir
J-Klar#4158,@KARTHIK What're you meant to do to solve 10 on the worksheet?
karthiccc#0069,uuuuh
karthiccc#0069,i havent done it yet
karthiccc#0069,let me give it a go
karthiccc#0069,ok so for 10 jake you have 2 equations
karthiccc#0069,1 is for volume
karthiccc#0069,and one is for the cost
karthiccc#0069,for volume you will have `v = x^2 * h`
karthiccc#0069,for cost you will have `1200 = 4x^2 + 8xh`
J-Klar#4158,ye
karthiccc#0069,the cost equation is just the equation for surface area but each coefficient is multiplied by the cost for that type of material
karthiccc#0069,now you isolate `h` from the cost equation
J-Klar#4158,ye
karthiccc#0069,then you re write volume as `v(x)`
karthiccc#0069,and replace the `h` with what you got after isolating
J-Klar#4158,yeah i just messed up writing my volume equation i think
J-Klar#4158,poggies
karthiccc#0069,:D
J-Klar#4158,I don't really think they're any transformers fans anywa
J-Klar#4158,also meets has auto generated captions

Lucаs#7263,And karthik you’d think there wood be more calculus gamers
Lucаs#7263,Literally any math or science basically requires it
Lucаs#7263,Engineering too

Pizzanat#6176,they can't handle it
karthiccc#0069,true but that doesnt mean everyone tyin to go into those
BlazeThief#4311,Mourning wood best enemy in terraria

karthiccc#0069,to train the ai
J-Klar#4158,Can you just get it to look at all google search results?
karthiccc#0069,i could
karthiccc#0069,but thats a whole another level of complexity to add
karthiccc#0069,not that easy to make a bot download images off the internet
J-Klar#4158,well you could just download a couple pages and then *FEED THE POOP* to it
J-Klar#4158,probably the better course of action
J-Klar#4158,but then you have to download pics of poop
karthiccc#0069,ill label the folder 'midterm'
karthiccc#0069,so we'll be all good

J-Klar#4158,nah its 0
Aho#7784,damn we all stupid
J-Klar#4158,trust
J-Klar#4158,me was thinking b is number so is derivative is 0 and x/b * 0 is 0
J-Klar#4158,thought i was smart
J-Klar#4158,just retard
J-Klar#4158,sadge
J-Klar#4158,just a bunch of rules

Aho#7784,why do I have the shitty looking version?
karthiccc#0069,hah scrub
Pizzanat#6176,karthik is cheating
Pizzanat#6176,ban him
karthiccc#0069,google chose me
karthiccc#0069,I have achieved dark mode
Aho#7784,wtf
Aho#7784,why am I left out?
Pizzanat#6176,i love his expression in karthik's screenshot
Lucаs#7263,bruh its perfect
Lucаs#7263,the face he makes when you try to divide out of a binomial
karthiccc#0069,when he say to come back?
J-Klar#4158,9:30 right?
J-Klar#4158,I think
Pizzanat#6176,Yeah 9:30
J-Klar#4158,Has anyone done 2a? Would you simplify lnx × lnx to lnx^2 then to 2lnx?
karthiccc#0069,i think that just makes it harder
karthiccc#0069,just keep it as lnx * lnx
karthiccc#0069,and differentiate
J-Klar#4158,What did you get
karthiccc#0069,2(x^lnx)(lnx/x)
J-Klar#4158,Wait so did you end up using the multiplication log rule
karthiccc#0069,nah just the product rule\
karthiccc#0069,from lnx * lnx
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
J-Klar#4158,I see that now
karthiccc#0069,ight leg boys?
J-Klar#4158,Bruh
J-Klar#4158,12:30

J-Klar#4158,Later on
J-Klar#4158,Do one of those
J-Klar#4158,The last page I believe
karthiccc#0069,7h is a full question
J-Klar#4158,O
J-Klar#4158,Ok
J-Klar#4158,I'm dumb then
J-Klar#4158,I'm pooping will do it after
Aho#7784,is 7 on page 343 just finding the p.o.i?
karthiccc#0069,not sure
karthiccc#0069,havent looked at it
J-Klar#4158,Isn't that extrema
karthiccc#0069,ya thats just edtrema
Aho#7784,oh wait I read the last but wrong
karthiccc#0069,so find horizontal tangents mate
J-Klar#4158,Extrema I hardly know her
J-Klar#4158,Have you watched Park and Recs?
karthiccc#0069,no
J-Klar#4158,On season 3
J-Klar#4158,It's good
J-Klar#4158,It's what that's from

J-Klar#4158,Not ur slave
karthiccc#0069,please?
J-Klar#4158,No
karthiccc#0069,:(
J-Klar#4158,I haven't watched that yet my mans
J-Klar#4158,That's just Chris Pratts character
J-Klar#4158,For 7h the restriction is x > 0 ribt
karthiccc#0069,yea
J-Klar#4158,And there isn't a va
karthiccc#0069,or HA
karthiccc#0069,yeah
J-Klar#4158,Ye
J-Klar#4158,Kinda dumb lol
Aho#7784,@karthiccc you done?
karthiccc#0069,not yet
karthiccc#0069,almost
karthiccc#0069,this one kinda a bitch
karthiccc#0069,cuz there is a hole
karthiccc#0069,and I don't know what to do if there is a hole
J-Klar#4158,Wut
Aho#7784,open circle
Aho#7784,isnt it?
J-Klar#4158,What determines the hole
karthiccc#0069,"""when finding the va"
karthiccc#0069,so there is a hole as ritchie said
J-Klar#4158,Oh is that what happens
karthiccc#0069,"""but now for like horizontal tangents"
J-Klar#4158,When there isn't a VA
karthiccc#0069,so do I use that in the chart or not
J-Klar#4158,No clue
Aho#7784,yeah but it does not exist
Aho#7784,you still use it
Aho#7784,dont you?
karthiccc#0069,i dunno man
karthiccc#0069,thats why im asking
karthiccc#0069,ritchie not even here so I cant ask
Aho#7784,you just use it as a main point
Aho#7784,but in the chart you DNE it
karthiccc#0069,true
J-Klar#4158,What derivative did you get
karthiccc#0069,for main derivative i got x(2lnx+1)
J-Klar#4158,Aight good
karthiccc#0069,and then second derivative i got 2lnx+3
J-Klar#4158,So did u get 1/e as your ht?
karthiccc#0069,i got 1/sqrt(e)
J-Klar#4158,Yeah but couldn't u just divide the two first
J-Klar#4158,Then subtract
J-Klar#4158,Meaning just -1 rather than getting -1/2
karthiccc#0069,wait how?
J-Klar#4158,Cheat the system
karthiccc#0069,show me
J-Klar#4158,Aight
J-Klar#4158,Wait I wrote it wrong gimme sec
karthiccc#0069,ight
J-Klar#4158,Nvm I'm dumb if you divide the whole side by two its still 1/2
J-Klar#4158,You're right
karthiccc#0069,ight now what you get for poi
J-Klar#4158,Haven't done that yet guess I'll do it now
karthiccc#0069,si
J-Klar#4158,Don't need to practice the chart
J-Klar#4158,Not sure what I did wrong
J-Klar#4158,I used 2xlnx+1/x×x^2 to get it
karthiccc#0069,wait wait
karthiccc#0069,show me your original derivative
J-Klar#4158,Just used product rule twice
J-Klar#4158,But one section just equaled 0
J-Klar#4158,So didn't include
karthiccc#0069,1/x * x^2 could have just been simplified to x
karthiccc#0069,that's messing you up
J-Klar#4158,Lame
J-Klar#4158,Aight with that I get what you got
karthiccc#0069,bet

Lucаs#7263,Then he’s blowing up a medieval castle with a rpg
Lucаs#7263,Fits the craftopia theme doe just random shit
BlazeThief#4311,Its definitely from the creators of craftopia
Lucаs#7263,Fr
BlazeThief#4311,Legit just don't know how to make a game normal
BlazeThief#4311,could have not had any guns and game would have looked pretty cool to me
BlazeThief#4311,Pokemon mmo
BlazeThief#4311,and you can merge the pokemon to make new combos
BlazeThief#4311,But instead we have gang wars with pokemon meat shields
Lucаs#7263,Exactly that is gaming perfection
J-Klar#4158,Oh the preview was just a white square
J-Klar#4158,Wanted to see what it was
J-Klar#4158,Still mad about that
BlazeThief#4311,Was he starting the class early because people didn't hand stuff in?
J-Klar#4158,No started at normal time
J-Klar#4158,Cuz people didn't hand stuff in
BlazeThief#4311,8 am is normal time for it?
J-Klar#4158,Yes
J-Klar#4158,8:05
BlazeThief#4311,Wait though
BlazeThief#4311,What makes you mad about that message if its the normal time
Lucаs#7263,He said it would@be dayled if the y handed it in

Aho#7784,1 hour doesnt matter
karthiccc#0069,ugh fine
karthiccc#0069,give me a minute
karthiccc#0069,finishing up a question
J-Klar#4158,Bruh what am I meant to do with x = lnx
J-Klar#4158,So e ^ x is x
J-Klar#4158,Like wut
Pizzanat#6176,yes
Pizzanat#6176,unless you made a mistake somewhere?
J-Klar#4158,Yes but what does that mean x is lol
J-Klar#4158,How is that possible
J-Klar#4158,Curve sketching question for reference
Pizzanat#6176,which question?
J-Klar#4158,370 8b
Pizzanat#6176,i don't think i did that one oof
J-Klar#4158,But I'm not missing something right
J-Klar#4158,When you set it to 0
J-Klar#4158,It's x = lnx
Pizzanat#6176,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Pizzanat#6176,i have no idea
J-Klar#4158,Literally makes 0 sense
J-Klar#4158,I think it might just mean there isn't an x int
Pizzanat#6176,yeah was going to say
J-Klar#4158,Cuz the answer doesn't exist
Pizzanat#6176,probably just no solution
J-Klar#4158,Lame
J-Klar#4158,Alright
J-Klar#4158,I thought I was just going crazy
Lucаs#7263,Desmos and look for x int
J-Klar#4158,Oo true
J-Klar#4158,Lemme see
J-Klar#4158,Yeah just no x int
J-Klar#4158,Nah this question is just wack as fuck. There is also no solution when you set the second derivative to 0 lol
J-Klar#4158,1/x^2 is the second derivative
karthiccc#0069,what question?
J-Klar#4158,Scroll up
J-Klar#4158,Some say he got lost in the scroll
J-Klar#4158,Others say that he is still scrolling to this day
karthiccc#0069,others say he forgot his glasses so couldn't make out what he was looking for
karthiccc#0069,all we know is
karthiccc#0069,he's called the stig
Aho#7784,@J-Klar call?
J-Klar#4158,sure
J-Klar#4158,Mage buffs poggies
J-Klar#4158,indirect that is
J-Klar#4158,holy moly they just vaccumed the life out of prowlers
J-Klar#4158,no remorse
BlazeThief#4311,Bruh
BlazeThief#4311,We no longer shilling with the sion strat lucas
BlazeThief#4311,Sadge
Aho#7784,bruh they removed the dash on stride breaker too
Aho#7784,jeez they legit said no to almost every moment item in the game
J-Klar#4158,tbf stride breaker
J-Klar#4158,is one of the most aids
J-Klar#4158,things every
J-Klar#4158,i dont even have a problem with prowerls
J-Klar#4158,but stride breaker
J-Klar#4158,is a thing of hate
Aho#7784,did they nerf every mobi item in the game? jeez
Aho#7784,thank god Darius and Garen players cant abuse that shit no more
J-Klar#4158,the original minions lmao
J-Klar#4158,look at this mfer
Lucаs#7263,Nah I gave up on sion after the enemy killed me when I tried to proxy int first wave
Lucаs#7263,Champ is bad
Lucаs#7263,Although I have skin for him so maybe one day I come back
Aho#7784,IS the test at 11 like usual?
Lucаs#7263,i think he said 10:59:59
Aho#7784,ahhh
Aho#7784,gotcha
Aho#7784,@karthiccc I need help
Aho#7784,how would you solve 2^e^x?
karthiccc#0069,well you would first do the derivative as a whole
karthiccc#0069,which is 2^e^x * ln2
karthiccc#0069,then the derivative of e^x
karthiccc#0069,which is e^x
Aho#7784,ln2?
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,look at derivatives for normal logarithms
Aho#7784,oh right
Lucаs#7263,technically wouldn't you also need to multiply by the derrivative of X? but since its 1 you just leave it out?
J-Klar#4158,If you a n00b
Aho#7784,yeah
Aho#7784,so does anyone knows when to use the weird logarithmic derivation?
Aho#7784,where we set everything to ln?
Lucаs#7263,I assume the question will ask for it
Lucаs#7263,but he basically just said use it when its too difficult to do it normally or cant
Aho#7784,but didnt he said that it'll make some question easier but you could also do it normally?
Aho#7784,like if you have a product inside of a quotient
Lucаs#7263,ye
Aho#7784,but what if you have a product inside of a quotient but the product us a ln then do we just have to do it the long ass way?
BlazeThief#4311,@everyone For people who want to play pso2 ngs tomorrow and your wifi crum
BlazeThief#4311,You can pre download it
BlazeThief#4311,They have made the old pso2 into ngs

BlazeThief#4311,Rip for bringing character over then
BlazeThief#4311,If what Lucas is saying is true
BlazeThief#4311,That your old ship dictates new
Lucаs#7263,why not just ship 2? cuz ur also going to miss out on all the weapons from pso2
Lucаs#7263,and cosmetics too
J-Klar#4158,Wtf is there to practice we didn't do anything
Pizzanat#6176,1 + 1 but with directions

Lucаs#7263,just most populatedf is 1
BlazeThief#4311,They have just one big server thing
J-Klar#4158,Why would you not just play and your old one
J-Klar#4158,Q times? To get in?
Lucаs#7263,not realy just more people vibing around I guess
BlazeThief#4311,Kyle just suggested 1 and didn't know that apparently the old ship your on would matter

J-Klar#4158,but i like mages
Pizzanat#6176,Ranged classes felt kind of boring though
J-Klar#4158,o
Pizzanat#6176,Since it is just stand there and spam attacks while barely having to dodge attacks
Pizzanat#6176,Especially if you're with a group of people
Pizzanat#6176,The monsters target all the melee people
Pizzanat#6176,So you just stand there
BlazeThief#4311,Summoner coming in 2022

Lucаs#7263,You look sick
J-Klar#4158,thanks man
BlazeThief#4311,Mage is cool
BlazeThief#4311,That what I mained in beta
BlazeThief#4311,But it got boring just sitting back spamming magic
J-Klar#4158,m a g e
BlazeThief#4311,Gotta be the battle mage
J-Klar#4158,so is there like disciplines or something
J-Klar#4158,for mage

BlazeThief#4311,They can use them all
BlazeThief#4311,yeah
J-Klar#4158,aight
BlazeThief#4311,not sure if they will have more in full game
BlazeThief#4311,but in beta you had like a normal and an aoe for each element
J-Klar#4158,i mean i like the sitting back and just dpsing
J-Klar#4158,mage fantasy
Lucаs#7263,Ap carry
BlazeThief#4311,I just like vibing straight in and dying
BlazeThief#4311,Kayn fantasy
Lucаs#7263,"""nah you go in and get a penta then solo elder and baron at the same time"
J-Klar#4158,wait im confused what is the difference between techniques and force
J-Klar#4158,are they the same class or
BlazeThief#4311,Thats what the team expects from a jungler
Lucаs#7263,ive seen you pull it off
BlazeThief#4311,Techniques are the abilities
BlazeThief#4311,Theres another class called techter or something like that
Lucаs#7263,there is also a techer
Lucаs#7263,ye
J-Klar#4158,yeah
BlazeThief#4311,Its like a magic one that uses a wand that melee attacks them
J-Klar#4158,nah i want ranged lad
BlazeThief#4311,but can range a bit aswell I think
Lucаs#7263,long range techniques and close range melee
BlazeThief#4311,Kyle played that one
Lucаs#7263,thats what they do
J-Klar#4158,so is force the element one?
Lucаs#7263,ye
BlazeThief#4311,They both use the element stuff I think
Lucаs#7263,just different styles
J-Klar#4158,ahhh i see
BlazeThief#4311,Techer like infuses it with their weapon
BlazeThief#4311,and melee attacks
BlazeThief#4311,aswell as casing the ranged stuff
J-Klar#4158,both use the techniques but then have different other thing
Lucаs#7263,force is more mage like techter is like a battlemage it say
J-Klar#4158,ye
J-Klar#4158,i see now
Lucаs#7263,not as long but still can do range
Lucаs#7263,and melee
J-Klar#4158,yeah im finna go mage then

J-Klar#4158,I meant pso2ng
J-Klar#4158,Lol
J-Klar#4158,What class
J-Klar#4158,Do u plan on playing
Lucаs#7263,remeber him linking ranger
J-Klar#4158,That what you're going?
Lucаs#7263,as a secondary
BlazeThief#4311,He played techer in beta
Lucаs#7263,i remember him playiong AR
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,I think it was techer main ranger secondary
Pizzanat#6176,mrak what subclass are you going to use as hunter?
Pizzanat#6176,cuz i might do fighter hunter
Pizzanat#6176,but i dunno about full melee
Pizzanat#6176,cuz some bosses are weird and super tall
Lucаs#7263,usually u can just stun them with they legs
Lucаs#7263,if they tall
BlazeThief#4311,I might do magic secondary or something
BlazeThief#4311,We will see
BlazeThief#4311,Or just use like ar one
BlazeThief#4311,then you have decent range
Pizzanat#6176,is that what happened when in the beta we saw the bosses fall over?
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah
Lucаs#7263,think so
BlazeThief#4311,you can stun them
BlazeThief#4311,But also
Pizzanat#6176,so strikers from dauntless
Pizzanat#6176,:D
BlazeThief#4311,Since you can jump super high
BlazeThief#4311,Shouldn't be a problem to hit anyway
J-Klar#4158,What secondary should I go
BlazeThief#4311,Not sure
BlazeThief#4311,There may be a guide on good combos
maximumeffort1#3058,I might go ranger for sub again
maximumeffort1#3058,Not sure what I’ll choose for main
Aho#7784,wtf

J-Klar#4158,is it later
karthiccc#0069,nope more later
karthiccc#0069,have to eat dinner
Aho#7784,too.... much... fucking.... WRITING
karthiccc#0069,my hand hurts
Pizzanat#6176,"""lol in biology"
Pizzanat#6176,so even more writing
karthiccc#0069,yeah but for bio you can type most of it
Aho#7784,but like... we're kinda in a MATH class
Aho#7784,also that box in the middle sketches me out
Aho#7784,that was concise??????????????
Pizzanat#6176,yeeeeeeee
Pizzanat#6176,super short and simple
Pizzanat#6176,1 hour
Pizzanat#6176,woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Aho#7784,well me sleep now
Aho#7784,3 lessons again?
Pizzanat#6176,yeeeeeeeeeee
J-Klar#4158,The box I drew is missing chromosomes
Lucаs#7263,yeew
Pizzanat#6176,just use a ruler
Pizzanat#6176,ez
Lucаs#7263,like father like son
J-Klar#4158,I did :)
Aho#7784,pls not make each lesson 1 hour
karthiccc#0069,I want to die
karthiccc#0069,this is soo boring
Lucаs#7263,idk i found this 3d stuff not too bad
Lucаs#7263,more interseting than calc at least
Aho#7784,"""With calc it was kinda fun"
J-Klar#4158,The 3d thing is interesting
Lucаs#7263,like it has so many real world applications
J-Klar#4158,The 2d part was just Mundo tower aa amounts of boring
Lucаs#7263,i could literally graph a vector that repressents jakes erect penis
Aho#7784,like its too specific
karthiccc#0069,what time we have to get back?
Lucаs#7263,10015
J-Klar#4158,suicide
J-Klar#4158,is what this makes me
J-Klar#4158,want to do
Lucаs#7263,idk why he spent so long on the two points thing
Lucаs#7263,like you could have done that last lesson didnt need to explain it so much
Aho#7784,"""hey we gotta fully understand"
Pizzanat#6176,we did already learn all of this pretty much in physics though
Pizzanat#6176,some people probably didn't take physics
Lucаs#7263,nah the origin thing jasp
Lucаs#7263,last unit he gave us the info to find components of a vector not starting at origin
J-Klar#4158,dude we didnt need to do any of this
J-Klar#4158,coulda just said
Lucаs#7263,literally just the differenfe of the points
J-Klar#4158,multiply points
J-Klar#4158,add points
Lucаs#7263,didnt lrearn that in physics
J-Klar#4158,and boom
J-Klar#4158,we done
J-Klar#4158,the lesson
Aho#7784,hes just going through the theory
Aho#7784,he didnt do this during calc so it was much faster
Aho#7784,but still
Aho#7784,why spend so long on it
J-Klar#4158,i literally could not care less
Aho#7784,I mean it helps some people understand better
Pizzanat#6176,maybe some people didn't take physics and don't understand vectors very well at all
Lucаs#7263,guess i can see that
J-Klar#4158,they can suffer then
J-Klar#4158,i dont care
J-Klar#4158,this course
J-Klar#4158,has killed math for me
J-Klar#4158,any kind of interest is dead
Lucаs#7263,at least it was shorter thats nice
J-Klar#4158,yeah man only 45 minutes
J-Klar#4158,my arm hurts so fucking much
karthiccc#0069,everyone said that vectors was the hardest part of this course
J-Klar#4158,its not hard
karthiccc#0069,i don't see it yet
J-Klar#4158,just boring af
Pizzanat#6176,maybe it is next unit?
J-Klar#4158,maybe thats what makes it hard
J-Klar#4158,u have to get past the suicidal thoughts
J-Klar#4158,adds a whole new meaning to failing
Pizzanat#6176,this unit is just vectors from physics
karthiccc#0069,difficulty increases exponentially
karthiccc#0069,also I guess people who haven't done physics call it hard
J-Klar#4158,uggos united
Pizzanat#6176,didn't a lot of people also say the entire course would get very difficult?
karthiccc#0069,yeah....
J-Klar#4158,:Sadge:
Pizzanat#6176,so people are just weird and find anything hard
J-Klar#4158,damn jasp being toxic
Lucаs#7263,i mean we do have the slimmed version
J-Klar#4158,rare
Lucаs#7263,that might help who knows
karthiccc#0069,can't really call it slimmed
karthiccc#0069,we get bombarded with lessons then a test the day immediately after the last
Lucаs#7263,i mean he did say he slimmed it down tho
J-Klar#4158,"""ah yes the famed alphabet. x"
karthiccc#0069,"""id say the quick pace evens it out in comparison to """"normal"""""""
Pizzanat#6176,the main thing is probably it being open book and that we don't have to remember as much from advanced functions
karthiccc#0069,the slimmed down portion is most likely just more theory
karthiccc#0069,and proofs
Pizzanat#6176,and that
J-Klar#4158,yeah man 12:30
J-Klar#4158,thanks
J-Klar#4158,sounds awesome

J-Klar#4158,@KARTHIK @Aho leg come
karthiccc#0069,i remember asking my sister what lesson was the hardest for her class and it was optimization and then our class just gets a median of 92%
J-Klar#4158,yeah that test
J-Klar#4158,was
J-Klar#4158,easy af
karthiccc#0069,we definitely have it easy in most cases
J-Klar#4158,so
Lucаs#7263,thats cuz ur sister was distracted when she was trying to study
Lucаs#7263,i was up in her dms
J-Klar#4158,and i was up in lucas's

Pizzanat#6176,yeeeeeeeeeeeee
BlazeThief#4311,They say its all about stealth
BlazeThief#4311,but just one shot headshot all of them
BlazeThief#4311,so what the point in stealth
Pizzanat#6176,"""might be a thing where if you're loud"
Pizzanat#6176,so you eventually get a lot more spooky guys
BlazeThief#4311,Maybe
BlazeThief#4311,It looks like it gets harder at the end anyway since the aliens have abilities and stuff
Pizzanat#6176,yeeee
Pizzanat#6176,including spooky guy smasher from fortnite save the world
maximumeffort1#3058,dont tell me its a whole new game
karthiccc#0069,it is
maximumeffort1#3058,jesus
karthiccc#0069,$$$
maximumeffort1#3058,no way thats worth
maximumeffort1#3058,$90 bucks for a stealth zombie game that could've been a dlc for an existing game
maximumeffort1#3058,or whatever ubisoft is pricing for it
BlazeThief#4311,Also apparently I missed
BlazeThief#4311,Crazy avatar game
karthiccc#0069,those graphics look nice
karthiccc#0069,my pc gonna die :(
J-Klar#4158,damn you should get some league in then
J-Klar#4158,]before it too late
karthiccc#0069,1 last question
karthiccc#0069,then we game
J-Klar#4158,what would you say I should prioritize when i do review
J-Klar#4158,the applications?
karthiccc#0069,honestly for me it was the physics stuff
karthiccc#0069,cuz that just takes more of an understanding of the question rather than just plug and play
karthiccc#0069,other than that you should definitely look at the applications of dot and cross product
karthiccc#0069,some questions get a little confusing
J-Klar#4158,mk
J-Klar#4158,by physicss stuff yuou mean the force and velocity questions right
karthiccc#0069,yeah
J-Klar#4158,mk
karthiccc#0069,ill hop on in like 40 mins jake
karthiccc#0069,gonna go eat something
J-Klar#4158,...
karthiccc#0069,literally have not eaten
J-Klar#4158,betrayed
karthiccc#0069,it be like that
J-Klar#4158,hmmmmmm
J-Klar#4158,2262010627 — Today at 20:12

J-Klar#4158,Maybe i study for midterms before the test
J-Klar#4158,to get clarity
karthiccc#0069,honestly
J-Klar#4158,me thinks its the play
karthiccc#0069,it works
J-Klar#4158,aight
J-Klar#4158,will do

J-Klar#4158,starfield comes next year
BlazeThief#4311,You still never said what that item was in eso jake
J-Klar#4158,what the fuck
J-Klar#4158,jack sparrow is in sea of thieves now i gues
J-Klar#4158,LMAO
BlazeThief#4311,ye
J-Klar#4158,its just an ingredient merak
J-Klar#4158,that makes an xp increasing potion
BlazeThief#4311,ohh
BlazeThief#4311,Like insta xp or an xp boost
J-Klar#4158,xp boost
BlazeThief#4311,Is it permanent or timed
J-Klar#4158,timed
BlazeThief#4311,Bruh
BlazeThief#4311,That just seems wack
J-Klar#4158,not why its expensive
BlazeThief#4311,I swear every single time a game gets shown
BlazeThief#4311,The chat just spams residentsleeper
J-Klar#4158,tbf this game looks shit
BlazeThief#4311,They got the tornado doe
J-Klar#4158,does this trailer
J-Klar#4158,want to end
BlazeThief#4311,Lol
BlazeThief#4311,That was battlefield

J-Klar#4158,also fka 'adventure'
maximumeffort1#3058,I’m not watching rn
J-Klar#4158,not missing much
J-Klar#4158,ooo gang beasts rip off
J-Klar#4158,yo thats me
BlazeThief#4311,Do they be saying halo multiplayer be free when it comes out?
BlazeThief#4311,It is
J-Klar#4158,gus pog
BlazeThief#4311,who gus
J-Klar#4158,from breaking bad'
BlazeThief#4311,amon gus
BlazeThief#4311,so this some breaking bad ting
J-Klar#4158,no lol
J-Klar#4158,its just the actor
BlazeThief#4311,ohh
BlazeThief#4311,They got the cock to fight
BlazeThief#4311,oh that was far cry
J-Klar#4158,enslaving them
J-Klar#4158,i guess
BlazeThief#4311,Slime rancher 2 electric boogaloo
J-Klar#4158,wtf
J-Klar#4158,is this
karthiccc#0069,jake
karthiccc#0069,i am seeing
karthiccc#0069,a lack of gaming
karthiccc#0069,being done
J-Klar#4158,cuz i watch this then study
J-Klar#4158,cuz i can do any of this
J-Klar#4158,so its a lil doomed
karthiccc#0069,can or can't?
J-Klar#4158,cant
karthiccc#0069,ah....
karthiccc#0069,well good luck with the study
J-Klar#4158,bruh all these games
J-Klar#4158,are just not hat sick
BlazeThief#4311,"""I thought halo"
J-Klar#4158,i mean forza looked cool i guess
J-Klar#4158,just dont care all that much
karthiccc#0069,@J-Klar
karthiccc#0069,still studying?
J-Klar#4158,yeah i just started
J-Klar#4158,i suck at this
karthiccc#0069,well keep at it
karthiccc#0069,you'll be fine
J-Klar#4158,Yeah
J-Klar#4158,no
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,yes
J-Klar#4158,you don't realise my average lmao
J-Klar#4158,Two forces of equal magnitude act at 60o to each other. If their resultant has
karthiccc#0069,yeah it would
J-Klar#4158,yeah but then the text book doesn't give the answer of 30n
J-Klar#4158,like how am i supposed to study
J-Klar#4158,when the textbook gives wrong answers
karthiccc#0069,wait lemme check somethin for that
karthiccc#0069,um @J-Klar
karthiccc#0069,does the textbook say answer is 10 root(3)?
J-Klar#4158,yes
karthiccc#0069,ah ok so um this is how you do it
karthiccc#0069,then use sine law
J-Klar#4158,i dont get why you cant just use a triangle tho
karthiccc#0069,honestly triangle law never worked for me
karthiccc#0069,parallelogram law is just better
J-Klar#4158,but it makes no sense
J-Klar#4158,if one angle of a triangle is 60
J-Klar#4158,and the other two are equal
karthiccc#0069,thats for the vectors
J-Klar#4158,because the sides are equal
J-Klar#4158,every angle should be the same
karthiccc#0069,ok well just think of it like this then
J-Klar#4158,cuz 120 / 2 is 60
karthiccc#0069,uh
karthiccc#0069,well vectors just weird
J-Klar#4158,and no idea what the next two questions are even asking
J-Klar#4158,so this is good
karthiccc#0069,send em ill help ya
karthiccc#0069,after game
karthiccc#0069,@everyone anyone want a sheet that has all the formulas on it
J-Klar#4158,sure
karthiccc#0069,shared it
J-Klar#4158,noice
J-Klar#4158,thanks
Lucаs#7263,SURE
J-Klar#4158,ok yeah the parralelogram
J-Klar#4158,is bae
J-Klar#4158,just so simple
J-Klar#4158,@KARTHIK Wouldn't 197) 5 just be two different work questions that you add together
karthiccc#0069,yeah but the answer in the textbook isnt what I got
karthiccc#0069,so i want to see if the textbook is just wack
karthiccc#0069,"""also"
Pizzanat#6176,its coming from the north east
Pizzanat#6176,so basically that but placed differently
Pizzanat#6176,also i did that question and i got 1546.8
karthiccc#0069,ye thats what I got too
Pizzanat#6176,so the textbook is BADDDDDDDDD
karthiccc#0069,fax
J-Klar#4158,ye its lame
Lucаs#7263,whichi questions?
J-Klar#4158,bruh
Lucаs#7263,the plame one he doing now or double work ting?
Pizzanat#6176,the weird one is the double work one on page 197 #5
Lucаs#7263,anyone do 13a?
Lucаs#7263,i dont get why its just het unit vectors
Pizzanat#6176,but what page?
Lucаs#7263,194
Pizzanat#6176,but those aren't unit vectors! they're the components of the vectors!
Pizzanat#6176,also you use them to make the vectors
Lucаs#7263,isnt it scalar versions of the unit vectors?
Lucаs#7263,scalar multiples
karthiccc#0069,"""project them onto (1"
Pizzanat#6176,aren't they just the ordered triples of each vertex?
Pizzanat#6176,they're not anything weird
karthiccc#0069,well yeah
Aho#7784,@karthiccc can you explain 12 153 again? I was late so I was confused on the diagram
karthiccc#0069,uuuuh
Aho#7784,join call to explain?
J-Klar#4158,(he doesn't)
karthiccc#0069,Only thing I remember from his explanation is that velocity of the plane relative to the air = velocity of plane relative to ground - velocity of wind relative to air
karthiccc#0069,not sure how much that helps
Aho#7784,how did you do it
karthiccc#0069,I didn't
Pizzanat#6176,its the same as in physics
Pizzanat#6176,which parts are confusing?
Aho#7784,why when you add the wind it goes up and not down
J-Klar#4158,opposite vectors
J-Klar#4158,also that was him subtracting it
karthiccc#0069,um in the question he is doing right now
karthiccc#0069,why does he have 120 degrees?
karthiccc#0069,isnt it 150?
J-Klar#4158,true
J-Klar#4158,dont tell him
J-Klar#4158,too late now
J-Klar#4158,would cause too  much pain
karthiccc#0069,too late
karthiccc#0069,imma tell him
J-Klar#4158,n o
J-Klar#4158,AHAHAHAA
J-Klar#4158,GET FUCKED
karthiccc#0069,damn
karthiccc#0069,literally right when I said it
J-Klar#4158,He is regretting life
J-Klar#4158,f
J-Klar#4158,f
J-Klar#4158,f
J-Klar#4158,f
J-Klar#4158,ruh roh
J-Klar#4158,oh no
karthiccc#0069,he still hasn't noticed
J-Klar#4158,this is bad
J-Klar#4158,oh fuck
J-Klar#4158,oh god
J-Klar#4158,sadge
J-Klar#4158,no
J-Klar#4158,i cant
karthiccc#0069,sry i don't have a mic
J-Klar#4158,i refuse
karthiccc#0069,grumpy
J-Klar#4158,invite him to discord
karthiccc#0069,nah that'll make him more grumpy
J-Klar#4158,maybe he plays leg
karthiccc#0069,lets get him to play league
J-Klar#4158,thats toxic karthik
J-Klar#4158,really gonna make a sad person play league
J-Klar#4158,wtf
karthiccc#0069,how to kill a mans soul:
karthiccc#0069,get him to play leg
J-Klar#4158,THATS WHY I LIKE IT SO MUCH
J-Klar#4158,i dont have a soul to be killed
karthiccc#0069,sadge
karthiccc#0069,makes sense
karthiccc#0069,gingers are the devil
J-Klar#4158,annie = ginger
J-Klar#4158,= jake
karthiccc#0069,ew
karthiccc#0069,jake
karthiccc#0069,you pedo
J-Klar#4158,stop
J-Klar#4158,forever
J-Klar#4158,stop
Aho#7784,so how do you know if there are opposite vectors or not?
Aho#7784,Im still confused
J-Klar#4158,well subtracting vector is just adding the negative
J-Klar#4158,and he wanted to get rid of the wind
J-Klar#4158,so used the oppsoite vector
Aho#7784,so when do you add the wind?
Aho#7784,when its going against the plane?
J-Klar#4158,not about that
J-Klar#4158,its the formula thing from the note
Aho#7784,ik
Aho#7784,but like when do you add or subtract the wind
J-Klar#4158,you dont add. you always initially graph it but if you need to isolate for the thing you can just subtract it
J-Klar#4158,he just translated the wind vector
J-Klar#4158,and reversed its direction
J-Klar#4158,to make the triangle
J-Klar#4158,but the original was still on the left
Aho#7784,ohh ok
J-Klar#4158,nidalee and friends
karthiccc#0069,LMAO
Aho#7784,toxic spamming him like that
J-Klar#4158,karthik wtf
J-Klar#4158,r u not just toxic
J-Klar#4158,o
Aho#7784,@karthiccc how do you find a angle between 2 points with the dot product?
Lucаs#7263,use the two calculationsn
Lucаs#7263,find the value and then sub it in
Aho#7784,oh ok
karthiccc#0069,nice
Aho#7784,can anyone explain how he got 85?
J-Klar#4158,already has 2 angles
J-Klar#4158,subtract from 180
Pizzanat#6176,Z pattern for the 60 degrees
Pizzanat#6176,and 25 is from the other angle since he just translated it over to make a parallelogram
Pizzanat#6176,so 60 + 25 = 85
Pizzanat#6176,and he had to use the 85 to find another angle so i don't think he subtracted from 180
Aho#7784,Thank you Jasper
J-Klar#4158,i keep looking up from my phone
J-Klar#4158,and this dude is just scowling at me
J-Klar#4158,its horrifying

J-Klar#4158,wut fuck up
karthiccc#0069,the projection equation
J-Klar#4158,wut do u mean wahts wrong with it
J-Klar#4158,cuz i used it lol
karthiccc#0069,there isn't absolute value bars on the numerator in the equation
karthiccc#0069,but on my cheat sheet i had them
J-Klar#4158,oh well no biggie
J-Klar#4158,just got a positive answer
J-Klar#4158,instead of a negative one
J-Klar#4158,ill play when everyone is done thickems
karthiccc#0069,ight G
Aho#7784,on which proj equation?

karthiccc#0069,in his world it does
J-Klar#4158,i want to live there
karthiccc#0069,fuck a plane
J-Klar#4158,intersecting planes pog
Lucаs#7263,join with a bunch of accounts
Lucаs#7263,and se if you can vote a lot
J-Klar#4158,do it urself
Pizzanat#6176,next leson time guys
Aho#7784,shading adds depth for a sphere lol
J-Klar#4158,your moms ass doesnt need any more depth than it already has
Aho#7784,damn
Aho#7784,how would you know?
Lucаs#7263,bought her OF
BlazeThief#4311,Rated it 1 out of 5
J-Klar#4158,is there actually a rating system lmao
J-Klar#4158,im responsible man im doing hw
J-Klar#4158,like a chad
BlazeThief#4311,And I have no idea
BlazeThief#4311,Would assume so
J-Klar#4158,why is that the literally only gif
J-Klar#4158,that comes up
J-Klar#4158,when you search
J-Klar#4158,Jake Klar
J-Klar#4158,"""""""Lucas Wagner"""""""
J-Klar#4158,You and Karthik aint got shit
karthiccc#0069,feels bad
J-Klar#4158,thiccums you doing hw
karthiccc#0069,haven't started
karthiccc#0069,got a certain question?
J-Klar#4158,eh not really its just the back of the book is kinda scuffed cuz for certain questions as there are multiple points u can get different answers depending on what you choose
karthiccc#0069,oh ye that is true
karthiccc#0069,but they should be pretty similar
karthiccc#0069,like a change of signs mostly
karthiccc#0069,right?
J-Klar#4158,pre much
J-Klar#4158,but no
J-Klar#4158,only a change of signs for d values created from points
J-Klar#4158,when you are doing parametric
J-Klar#4158,the numbers would be different
J-Klar#4158,depending on the point you choose
karthiccc#0069,oh true true
J-Klar#4158,well actually 5c on 286 i dont get the answer for
karthiccc#0069,im not even close to there
karthiccc#0069,still on the other page
J-Klar#4158,n00b
Lucаs#7263,wha5t did yuou get for 5c jake
J-Klar#4158,just 0
J-Klar#4158,0=0
Lucаs#7263,what did your cross product get?
Lucаs#7263,for n
J-Klar#4158,"""0"
Lucаs#7263,"""-12"
J-Klar#4158,wut how
J-Klar#4158,what p and d did u use
Lucаs#7263,what you mean p and d
Lucаs#7263,its a x b
Lucаs#7263,which are the 2 direction vectors
Lucаs#7263,cross prduct of them to find n
J-Klar#4158,but in the example u use a direction vector and op which is just the point
Lucаs#7263,in what example
J-Klar#4158,from the note
Lucаs#7263,cuz the two direction vectors were scalar multiples
Lucаs#7263,meaning they were the same vector
Lucаs#7263,so you needed another one
J-Klar#4158,bruh this is why 1 example doesn't work
J-Klar#4158,so u just use the two ds given in the vector form then
J-Klar#4158,and cross product them
J-Klar#4158,?
Lucаs#7263,to get n yeah
J-Klar#4158,lame
Lucаs#7263,but wacks me out because -12 0 0 is wierd because A cant be negative and multiplyingh by -1 feels weird
Lucаs#7263,because it would only change hte 12 not the 0's
J-Klar#4158,well you just move it to the other side of the 0
J-Klar#4158,o u mean for the normal
J-Klar#4158,thats not a thing is it? it was just that scalar form
J-Klar#4158,has to have first term positive
Lucаs#7263,yeah but the first term in the scalar equation uses A and A is -12
Lucаs#7263,and doesnt the question askl for scalar eqn?
J-Klar#4158,yeah and you just move it to the other side of 0
Lucаs#7263,ou
J-Klar#4158,which would just make it positive
Lucаs#7263,i c
J-Klar#4158,best note ever
J-Klar#4158,of all time
J-Klar#4158,ever
karthiccc#0069,short and simple
J-Klar#4158,wtf
J-Klar#4158,why
J-Klar#4158,who
J-Klar#4158,no
J-Klar#4158,kill me
J-Klar#4158,but like why
J-Klar#4158,who
J-Klar#4158,no
J-Klar#4158,fuck u people if you voted for that
Aho#7784,he hit us with the okay
J-Klar#4158,sAJBP:EGFKLO{Bna }PT
karthiccc#0069,i said yes
J-Klar#4158,12:30
Aho#7784,get it done and over with
J-Klar#4158,good stuff
J-Klar#4158,yeah man cant wait to finish at 1:30
karthiccc#0069,get it done today so we have 2 days (technically) to practice these lessons
J-Klar#4158,dude its just two lessons tmrw who cares
karthiccc#0069,and 1 day for the last one
J-Klar#4158,nope cringe af
J-Klar#4158,stupid
karthiccc#0069,if its a long one then its probably hard or takes time to understand
J-Klar#4158,so
Aho#7784,also we can do the review today too
J-Klar#4158,idc
Lucаs#7263,i wanted to do it tmrw
J-Klar#4158,LUCAS YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
Lucаs#7263,i work today so id rather do it tmrw when i have more time
J-Klar#4158,yeah man let me do 8am -> 1:30 then review too
J-Klar#4158,makes perfect sense
karthiccc#0069,i mean
karthiccc#0069,id rather that
J-Klar#4158,nope
J-Klar#4158,just split it equally
J-Klar#4158,i have a life
J-Klar#4158,i want to live
Lucаs#7263,ey man i dont mind doing ashit ton of math for a few days
Lucаs#7263,itll be over by 1:30 on friday
J-Klar#4158,he could have at least made it not start at 12 fucking 30
Lucаs#7263,just think tmrw we gonna have a tiny lesson
Lucаs#7263,not likely gonna be more than 1 hour
Lucаs#7263,so thne we done befreo 9
J-Klar#4158,dude i would have been fine with just doing half today
J-Klar#4158,that would have been much better
J-Klar#4158,i hate math so much
Lucаs#7263,bruh i was listening to music on youtube
Lucаs#7263,adn then it autoplqyed some indian dude commenting on a shess championship
Lucаs#7263,and he said the game  of chess is like life
Lucаs#7263,and that the movie rocky saaid it best
Lucаs#7263,"""doesnt matter how many times you get knocked down"
Pizzanat#6176,your music has really enlightening messages
Lucаs#7263,it really do doe
karthiccc#0069,for 8b on 280 did you guys just use the vectors from both lines
karthiccc#0069,because the answer from the textbook uses the vector from one of the lines then makes another using the points from each
karthiccc#0069,both should be correct right?
Lucаs#7263,yes
J-Klar#4158,lucas have you done 7c
Lucаs#7263,what page
J-Klar#4158,286
Lucаs#7263,not yet ill edo it now
J-Klar#4158,let me know what you get
Lucаs#7263,2y-2=0
J-Klar#4158,oh yeah im dumb you just simplify
J-Klar#4158,for the textbook answer
Lucаs#7263,divide both by 2 ye
J-Klar#4158,wait
J-Klar#4158,what were your ds
J-Klar#4158,cuz i only got the 2y
Lucаs#7263,"""-2"
Lucаs#7263,i named the three points in order p q r
Lucаs#7263,and my d vectors were pq and pr
Lucаs#7263,and then the r1 vector was just p
Lucаs#7263,or op
J-Klar#4158,"""well my second d was (3"
J-Klar#4158,cuz
J-Klar#4158,i used the two other points
J-Klar#4158,which just then gives 2y
Lucаs#7263,did you start with the same point for each?
J-Klar#4158,no do u need to?
Lucаs#7263,ye
J-Klar#4158,aight
Lucаs#7263,its like the diagram
J-Klar#4158,makes sense
J-Klar#4158,yeah imma be hoenst
J-Klar#4158,my diagram wack
J-Klar#4158,so
J-Klar#4158,that makes sense tho
Lucаs#7263,get someone wto send diagram pics
Lucаs#7263,helps a fair bit
Lucаs#7263,i find
J-Klar#4158,eh ill just keep making small mistakes and you'll tell me why
J-Klar#4158,easier that way
Lucаs#7263,yeah well one time ill be studying for midterms and wont be there
Lucаs#7263,also the note he made3 on the one note literally tells you what to do given tyhe information
Lucаs#7263,if you copied that too
J-Klar#4158,yeah not really tho
J-Klar#4158,3 points (create the direction vectors) doesn't exactly tell me that the first has to be the same
Lucаs#7263,diagram tells you that
Lucаs#7263,or add to the note
Lucаs#7263,and there u go easy cheat sheet on test
Lucаs#7263,mans gotta get theese tests back there one person in the goog meet
Lucаs#7263,wanna see if i can fail this test or not
J-Klar#4158,u done 9 on 286
Lucаs#7263,now
karthiccc#0069,i got 8x-11y+10z+46 = 0 for 9 jake
J-Klar#4158,aight same
J-Klar#4158,text book just fucked then
Lucаs#7263,i got 8x+11y-10z+46 = 0
karthiccc#0069,i just put the point into the equation in the textbook and it doesn't even come out as 0
karthiccc#0069,the textbook is def scuffed
J-Klar#4158,lame
karthiccc#0069,um lucas
karthiccc#0069,think you meant to have -46
Lucаs#7263,no
karthiccc#0069,its wrong then
Lucаs#7263,no
karthiccc#0069,because if you put the points into that
karthiccc#0069,it aint 0
Lucаs#7263,no
karthiccc#0069,:Squint:
Lucаs#7263,bruh what is this
Lucаs#7263,i have been tricked
J-Klar#4158,oo fun
Lucаs#7263,karthik what was your n
Lucаs#7263,and r1
J-Klar#4158,"""-8"
Lucаs#7263,yeah jake so then sub that in
J-Klar#4158,"""point was 2"
Lucаs#7263,oh wait
Lucаs#7263,missed the doubvle negative with -8 and the subtraction
J-Klar#4158,retard
Lucаs#7263,yes
J-Klar#4158,yes
karthiccc#0069,yes
karthiccc#0069,why the fuck do we go back 30 so pages

karthiccc#0069,same man
Aho#7784,SO MANY LEFT OUT NEGATIVE
karthiccc#0069,i really don't wanna do a retest
karthiccc#0069,probably not gonna in the end
karthiccc#0069,i see you jordan
Aho#7784,lowkey got scared that he knew I wasnt listening to him
karthiccc#0069,lmao
J-Klar#4158,depending on what i get as my final i might not even bother
karthiccc#0069,yeah its not like we need to aim for the top anymore
J-Klar#4158,yup
J-Klar#4158,i just need to not fail lmao
J-Klar#4158,my average is so bad but not as bad as i thought
J-Klar#4158,so thats good
Lucаs#7263,karthik what u get on that
J-Klar#4158,He doesn't need to be a dick about it
J-Klar#4158,Y should I
Aho#7784,oof
J-Klar#4158,Clearly I know what to do
karthiccc#0069,got 90.9% lucas
Aho#7784,Sadge
karthiccc#0069,mans could've just made it a 91 but he built different
Lucаs#7263,think he does when he inputs them
karthiccc#0069,what u get big man
Lucаs#7263,not good
Aho#7784,I got a 90
Aho#7784,10% off legit every smallest mistakes possibles
Lucаs#7263,those are rip marks for u guys damn
Aho#7784,all involve a negative sign
karthiccc#0069,brought my average down 3%
karthiccc#0069,feels bad man
karthiccc#0069,but lucas how bad is not good
Lucаs#7263,like 80
Lucаs#7263,.6
karthiccc#0069,damn....
Lucаs#7263,i mean my average pre covid was like 86 for gr11 math
Lucаs#7263,dont htink i was ever legendary
karthiccc#0069,at least it aint below 80
J-Klar#4158,lol
J-Klar#4158,imagine
karthiccc#0069,oh no
J-Klar#4158,you realise all but 1 of my tests have been below an 80 right
Lucаs#7263,upgrade assessment
Lucаs#7263,do it on the mose wieghted one
Lucаs#7263,and pog out
J-Klar#4158,or
J-Klar#4158,i just dont
Aho#7784,as long as its above 70
J-Klar#4158,well my average is yes
Aho#7784,it should cause no harm other than MAYBE your scholarship
J-Klar#4158,well it doesn't harm that either
J-Klar#4158,conditions were my average for the school year was 80%
J-Klar#4158,and all my other classes are above a 90
J-Klar#4158,so
Aho#7784,YOu had that pre type
Aho#7784,fucker
karthiccc#0069,nah
Aho#7784,damn Im just slow
Aho#7784,at typing
J-Klar#4158,mfer really got a 90 and called it a bad mark lmao
karthiccc#0069,asian bad
Lucаs#7263,thats what im saying mane they just built different
J-Klar#4158,you wouldn't even want to know what I got
J-Klar#4158,might make you throw up
Lucаs#7263,they parents still around to beat them
Aho#7784,this whole course has been bad for me
J-Klar#4158,would have made old jake throw up
karthiccc#0069,i mean its not like our parents are strict about it anymore
karthiccc#0069,more like we just keep the standards ingrained in our heads
J-Klar#4158,a mfer cried in the car in grade 10 when he got a 70 but dude could not care less about his 63.6. evoloution
Aho#7784,true Im just strict on myself
Aho#7784,cause I really need to understand calc and I kinda dont
Lucаs#7263,my parents literally never cared i think
karthiccc#0069,not sure if thats good or bad
J-Klar#4158,mine do
J-Klar#4158,but they aint gonna beat me
Lucаs#7263,cant ever remember them telling me to try harder or anything
J-Klar#4158,o
J-Klar#4158,god i must be failure prime if u do better with 0 motivation from parents
Lucаs#7263,aint how it works
J-Klar#4158,eh
J-Klar#4158,its a little funny tho
J-Klar#4158,got a bunch of 60s and then just a 96
J-Klar#4158,and cuz i actually studied i think ill get a good mark on this too
karthiccc#0069,:D
J-Klar#4158,i mean if i get a 90 on this ill have a 75.2
J-Klar#4158,which is completely fine
J-Klar#4158,and then if i maybe do a retest on the first and get a 90
J-Klar#4158,itll be higher
J-Klar#4158,and if i get 100s itll be even even higher
J-Klar#4158,but
J-Klar#4158,ill see what i finish with
karthiccc#0069,as long as you aint gonna get cucked with the marks
karthiccc#0069,you should be fine
J-Klar#4158,wut u mean
karthiccc#0069,like your next mark
J-Klar#4158,i dont think i can
J-Klar#4158,but if i did i could just retest
Aho#7784,I mean its gonna be very hard for him to cuck it so much that his avg will drop below 80
karthiccc#0069,exactly so you should be fine
J-Klar#4158,yeah im pretty sure it is actually impossible
J-Klar#4158,for my avg to go below an 80
J-Klar#4158,i think i need to fail
Lucаs#7263,@KARTHIK noob
Aho#7784,Imagine
Aho#7784,trying to be different
karthiccc#0069,haha stfu
Lucаs#7263,ngl this kinda fun
Lucаs#7263,not as bad as other stuff
karthiccc#0069,more of a puzzle
Aho#7784,yeah
Aho#7784,I like this
Lucаs#7263,are these supposed to be vectors as well?
Aho#7784,huh?
karthiccc#0069,they can be
J-Klar#4158,rn they just equation boys
Aho#7784,they can be equations too right?
karthiccc#0069,ah thats how it is
karthiccc#0069,fast POI calcs
J-Klar#4158,'fast'
karthiccc#0069,tbf instead of using the tildas to leave space you can have a row calc each time
karthiccc#0069,instead of leaving some
J-Klar#4158,true
Lucаs#7263,id rather this than the other poi stuff
J-Klar#4158,...
Lucаs#7263,its not faster but requires less knowledge
J-Klar#4158,a 2 second thing
J-Klar#4158,or a crossword puzzel
J-Klar#4158,k
Lucаs#7263,you just sauce the bois in and then boom boom pow
Aho#7784,I mean this could be faster once we get use to this
J-Klar#4158,eh
J-Klar#4158,it takes ages to write it out
karthiccc#0069,well if you have vectors then i think this is easier
karthiccc#0069,especially for 3d
karthiccc#0069,and with multiple planes
Aho#7784,I want to sleep in
J-Klar#4158,why would we want it to 8:05
Aho#7784,9 please
J-Klar#4158,who would want that
J-Klar#4158,freaks
J-Klar#4158,get me out of this dog shit course
J-Klar#4158,wooooofwoooooooooofwooooooooofwoooooooof
J-Klar#4158,wooooooooof
J-Klar#4158,wooooooooooof
J-Klar#4158,woooooooooooooooof
J-Klar#4158,woooooooooooooooooooof
J-Klar#4158,wooooooooooooooooooooooof
J-Klar#4158,wooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
karthiccc#0069,you call it dog shit but you'll use everything from now on in uni
J-Klar#4158,woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
J-Klar#4158,p a i n
Aho#7784,oof
Aho#7784,90.9%
J-Klar#4158,kys
Aho#7784,I got 90.3 so mine didnt change from 90
J-Klar#4158,k y s
Aho#7784,what did you get?
J-Klar#4158,i already said
Lucаs#7263,legit got a mark off cuz my calculator didnt simplify and i just wrote the decimal answer
J-Klar#4158,yeah i lost 2 marks for being too smart
Lucаs#7263,need to get a super calculator
J-Klar#4158,tough world
karthiccc#0069,yeah this is the second time with a .9
karthiccc#0069,like just go up
karthiccc#0069,wtf
J-Klar#4158,PPL
J-Klar#4158,it might be operation frag time
J-Klar#4158,TECHNICALLY
J-Klar#4158,if i get 100
J-Klar#4158,on retest
karthiccc#0069,start studyin jakey
J-Klar#4158,(first test)
karthiccc#0069,:smort:
J-Klar#4158,and this test
J-Klar#4158,i can get an 82
J-Klar#4158,average
J-Klar#4158,for course
J-Klar#4158,the question is
J-Klar#4158,do i care
Lucаs#7263,why do first test
Lucаs#7263,2nd and 4th are worth more
J-Klar#4158,of
J-Klar#4158,oh
J-Klar#4158,they are
Lucаs#7263,unless you did better on thoise
J-Klar#4158,second was better
J-Klar#4158,what was the 4th called
Lucаs#7263,it was the other one with graphs
Lucаs#7263,the last calc
J-Klar#4158,i was just gonna do the first cuz it would be easy for me now
Aho#7784,I found the first the worst one
J-Klar#4158,apparently i found this one the worst
J-Klar#4158,which i dont really understand tbh
J-Klar#4158,but that number that thing does not lie lul
J-Klar#4158,if i fnish the intersections of lines and planes hw
J-Klar#4158,then i can do this matrix crap and tmrws lesson hw tmrw
J-Klar#4158,and start review after that
J-Klar#4158,later in day
J-Klar#4158,+ 3 hours before test
J-Klar#4158,that is the play me thinks
J-Klar#4158,and maybe I do some of the matrix stuff later today
J-Klar#4158,if no one plays with me
J-Klar#4158,ill probably just ask him how to determine which retest would be the most beneficial for me
karthiccc#0069,today is grind time
karthiccc#0069,same with tomorrow
karthiccc#0069,league shall wait
J-Klar#4158,anyone done 7 on 292
Lucаs#7263,Didn’t do it but you need o convert the plane to conponent form then dot those to get n which should be the line
Lucаs#7263,"""Use the 0"
Lucаs#7263,I think that’s r1
J-Klar#4158,why cant you just take the coefficents of x y an z like with lines
J-Klar#4158,yeah 000 is the point
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,t = 1/2
Lucаs#7263,Oh yeah do that then
Lucаs#7263,Raider
Lucаs#7263,Easier
J-Klar#4158,wait did u do what i did karthik
Lucаs#7263,Forgot that n is just right there
karthiccc#0069,yes jake
karthiccc#0069,you take the coefficients
karthiccc#0069,because thats the normal vector
karthiccc#0069,and the normal vector becomes the direction vector for the line
J-Klar#4158,but i got t = 2
J-Klar#4158,ye
J-Klar#4158,thats what i did
J-Klar#4158,must have just done the math wrong
karthiccc#0069,ok what did you do to get t = 2?
karthiccc#0069,did you get to 62t = 31?
J-Klar#4158,im retarded
J-Klar#4158,yes
J-Klar#4158,i did
J-Klar#4158,LMAO
karthiccc#0069,yeah
J-Klar#4158,idek
karthiccc#0069,jake
karthiccc#0069,you
karthiccc#0069,need
karthiccc#0069,to
karthiccc#0069,slow down maybe?
J-Klar#4158,i make it regardless of speed
J-Klar#4158,apparently i changed a question on my test
karthiccc#0069,i make those mistakes all the time
karthiccc#0069,just slowing down helps
J-Klar#4158,yeah but im never looking at that cuz im used to just being wrong in theory lol
J-Klar#4158,what did u get for t for 8 if you've done it
J-Klar#4158,i got -15/19
karthiccc#0069,yeah I change questions on tests all the time too
karthiccc#0069,most my marks are gone cuz of that
karthiccc#0069,switch the question from - to +
karthiccc#0069,honestly its kinda smart if you think about it cuz i changed a question to an easier one on one of these tests by changing - to + and he only took off 0.5 marks
karthiccc#0069,so you have higher chance of getting more marks for tougher questions
J-Klar#4158,ez
J-Klar#4158,will just do that then
J-Klar#4158,thanks for the tip karthik
J-Klar#4158,oml there is a sphere
J-Klar#4158,pog the matrices is a ws
J-Klar#4158,work sheet
J-Klar#4158,no wack book
J-Klar#4158,this bitch sideways
Lucаs#7263,Karthik that strat is disgusting
Lucаs#7263,One time I accidentally did that tho and he took off 2 fulls marks and wrote “your mistake made it significantly easier”
Lucаs#7263,So doesn’t always work
J-Klar#4158,thats hilarious
karthiccc#0069,dang
karthiccc#0069,well i guess it aint fool proof
J-Klar#4158,When do matrixes you cant do Row 1 + Row 2 right
J-Klar#4158,even tho its technically a multiple of 1
J-Klar#4158,youd have to Row 1 + 2Row 2
Lucаs#7263,Nah I think u can
Lucаs#7263,Ask him
Lucаs#7263,Oh he gone
Lucаs#7263,Look it up
J-Klar#4158,u can
J-Klar#4158,pog
Aho#7784,You can do r1 + r2?
Aho#7784,Well technically it would be r1 + 1r2 which is the same thing
Aho#7784,He did it in one of the example I’m pretty sure
karthiccc#0069,yeah he did
karthiccc#0069,oh boy
karthiccc#0069,nvm was actually pretty easy
J-Klar#4158,you just do it like normal right
J-Klar#4158,but now they have squares
karthiccc#0069,yeah
J-Klar#4158,idk if i did it right cuz the textbook didn't even have an answer but i got +- root 8
maximumeffort1#3058,Sometimes I’m glad I’m too dumb for your math
BlazeThief#4311,My family got a scale we checked the weight last night lads
BlazeThief#4311,Just barely 150
karthiccc#0069,root *?
karthiccc#0069,i got t = 1 or t = 2
karthiccc#0069,and the 2 points are
karthiccc#0069,"""(1"
J-Klar#4158,welp
Lucаs#7263,Oof for you merak
Lucаs#7263,Oof
Lucаs#7263,Oof
Lucаs#7263,Pog
Lucаs#7263,Bruh autocorrect rally doing you dirty
Lucаs#7263,How’d the 5k go
Lucаs#7263,Or is that at the end of the week
karthiccc#0069,love the worksheet for matrices being landscape
J-Klar#4158,yeah
J-Klar#4158,its annoing af
J-Klar#4158,i got a prompt to use lumni pdf tho
J-Klar#4158,and that has a rotate feature
J-Klar#4158,so
J-Klar#4158,we gucci
J-Klar#4158,all this writing
J-Klar#4158,im for sure gonna get artheritus
J-Klar#4158,my right ring finger especially for some reaosn
J-Klar#4158,one more freaking question
Lucаs#7263,@KARTHIK how you do the sphere
karthiccc#0069,same as any other
karthiccc#0069,just you'll get 2 t values
karthiccc#0069,and 2 points
Lucаs#7263,do you have top make the eqation = 0 or anthing
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,it becomes a quadratic equation
karthiccc#0069,and then you just solve for t
Lucаs#7263,ight
Lucаs#7263,Uh oh
Lucаs#7263,The bot is on
Lucаs#7263,Karthik you should make a polling system for it that would actually be worth
epicgamer#7893,god has returned
Lucаs#7263,Also can we make the picture not of my photo from like 8 years ago
karthiccc#0069,oh?
Lucаs#7263,Perfect
epicgamer#7893,Hi its me Lucas
Lucаs#7263,I’m flattered you have that saved
karthiccc#0069,of course
karthiccc#0069,its sexy
karthiccc#0069,also what you mean polling system?
karthiccc#0069,cuz i actually do want functionality for this bot
karthiccc#0069,other than being the dictator and prohibiting speach
J-Klar#4158,make it be my friend
J-Klar#4158,please
karthiccc#0069,uh
karthiccc#0069,how you want it to do that?
J-Klar#4158,Surprise me
Lucаs#7263,Just make it have a voting system where it has a time limit on voting yes and no emojis and then puts a output message on which emoji thing won and then deletes its old post so u can’t vote more
karthiccc#0069,yeah but like whats the purpose of that
karthiccc#0069,seems kinda useless
karthiccc#0069,i want it to be a bot that we'd actually use
karthiccc#0069,right now imma make it so that the chewsday chat can only be written in by jake
J-Klar#4158,AYE
J-Klar#4158,me likey
J-Klar#4158,that
Lucаs#7263,I would think that we would use it for voting on things but I’m not sure what we would use a voting feature for
karthiccc#0069,exactly
J-Klar#4158,kick kyle out
karthiccc#0069,but i am open to ideas
karthiccc#0069,so keep em coming
Lucаs#7263,Make it dumbass that was sarcasm
Lucаs#7263,Use it for any time we wanna ask a question to the whole server
Lucаs#7263,We have done it before
J-Klar#4158,....
karthiccc#0069,fine ill add a voting feature
J-Klar#4158,@everyone
J-Klar#4158,problem solved
Lucаs#7263,But jasper just moderated it
Lucаs#7263,Yeah but nobody said anything
Lucаs#7263,No input from them
J-Klar#4158,tell them that if they dont vote we ban thiem forever no exceptions
J-Klar#4158,idc if ur family is dying in the hospital
J-Klar#4158,you kill
karthiccc#0069,you is kill
BlazeThief#4311,5k was wack lucas
BlazeThief#4311,Body wasn't ready
BlazeThief#4311,So did more walking than running
karthiccc#0069,wait you ran 5k merak?
Lucаs#7263,Eh man the distance is the distance
epicgamer#7893,Hi its me Lucas
BlazeThief#4311,I ran for at least half the first lap
BlazeThief#4311,But almost threw up since we in the sun
karthiccc#0069,yeah that would be an L
BlazeThief#4311,It was pretty much just 2 laps of 2.5k
karthiccc#0069,honestly running kinda wack
BlazeThief#4311,Went to some trail
BlazeThief#4311,So After the first lap I was like in sick purgatory for at least 3/4ths of the second lap
BlazeThief#4311,But we done now at least
karthiccc#0069,i remember whenever we did the pacer test back in elementary school i would find it hard to breathe for the rest of the day
karthiccc#0069,hated any kind of running since
karthiccc#0069,wack stuff
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah running sadge
BlazeThief#4311,Especially in winter
J-Klar#4158,nobody likes running
J-Klar#4158,kills you inside
Pizzanat#6176,D:
Pizzanat#6176,but long distance is not fun though yeah
BlazeThief#4311,Track team mans has entered the chat
BlazeThief#4311,Did you do hurdles jasper?
Pizzanat#6176,no
BlazeThief#4311,Ooooooof
karthiccc#0069,i wanted to do the pogostick for track
karthiccc#0069,but got scared
BlazeThief#4311,Pogostick
BlazeThief#4311,Like the hopping thing?
J-Klar#4158,Why does this exist
J-Klar#4158,That was some of the best content I've ever seen
J-Klar#4158,the cho gath one is really good
BlazeThief#4311,Godzilla just awoke in the cho one
karthiccc#0069,yeah the cho one was amazing
karthiccc#0069,nom
karthiccc#0069,nom
karthiccc#0069,nom
karthiccc#0069,nom
karthiccc#0069,NOM
J-Klar#4158,karthik let me know if you wish to become a leaguer
BlazeThief#4311,You watch loki yet today jake/
J-Klar#4158,no! I need to though
J-Klar#4158,have you?
BlazeThief#4311,Nah
J-Klar#4158,i hope its good
BlazeThief#4311,Gonna tonight
J-Klar#4158,it looked good
BlazeThief#4311,First ep was baller
J-Klar#4158,i havent watched any yet
J-Klar#4158,how long are they?
BlazeThief#4311,Like 40 minutes I think
BlazeThief#4311,Maybe a bit longer
J-Klar#4158,maybe ill wait for them to all come out
karthiccc#0069,the chewsday channel is now jakes
BlazeThief#4311,Karthik the god killer
BlazeThief#4311,Even jasper cant type
karthiccc#0069,i mean
J-Klar#4158,only the true god can
karthiccc#0069,its jake only
BlazeThief#4311,Might as well rename the channel the slums
J-Klar#4158,what the
karthiccc#0069,type here
J-Klar#4158,HELLO
BlazeThief#4311,Hello
karthiccc#0069,whenever people screw it up
BlazeThief#4311,Jasper
karthiccc#0069,wiat
BlazeThief#4311,What has he done
BlazeThief#4311,Please
BlazeThief#4311,Not agian
Pizzanat#6176,i can still change permissions so i can type in it muahhahahhahahahahhahaha
Pizzanat#6176,as in remove its permission to manage messages
Pizzanat#6176,but anyways
Pizzanat#6176,its probably fine
Pizzanat#6176,:D
karthiccc#0069,um it would have been real bad for a sec
karthiccc#0069,"""because you could have typed """"here"""" in this chat"""
Pizzanat#6176,here
karthiccc#0069,and it would have deleted every single message except jake's
Pizzanat#6176,WHAT'\
karthiccc#0069,i turned it off
Pizzanat#6176,D:
Lucаs#7263,Here
BlazeThief#4311,Jasper
BlazeThief#4311,This is like
BlazeThief#4311,The diamonds
BlazeThief#4311,give this man power
karthiccc#0069,the diamonds moment
BlazeThief#4311,100 million dimonds
BlazeThief#4311,Everything is destroyed
BlazeThief#4311,We would lose the grandma face
Pizzanat#6176,ez
BlazeThief#4311,Ez
karthiccc#0069,its not a fun command
karthiccc#0069,but its the only way to turn off the bot from the server
karthiccc#0069,ready?
karthiccc#0069,kill lucas
Pizzanat#6176,hmmm
BlazeThief#4311,He looks very alive still
Pizzanat#6176,it still seems to be on
karthiccc#0069,yeah I don't get why he still online
karthiccc#0069,the terminal stopped on my computer
BlazeThief#4311,He is sentient
karthiccc#0069,oh there he goes
Pizzanat#6176,o ther we go
karthiccc#0069,so not so instant
Pizzanat#6176,so while he is dead we can type in chewsday?
karthiccc#0069,"""alright so give me ideas for """"lucas"""" to be more useful"""
karthiccc#0069,yeah you can jasper
BlazeThief#4311,You have to make it so whenever someone says any form of the word poo
BlazeThief#4311,It posts a picture of lucas's poo
Pizzanat#6176,but when he comes back on he just deletes non-jake messages?
karthiccc#0069,not right away
karthiccc#0069,"""you have to type """"here"""""""
karthiccc#0069,then it will
Pizzanat#6176,interesting
karthiccc#0069,or actually it will delete everything from start onwards
karthiccc#0069,"""but to delete past messages you have to type """"here"""""""
epicgamer#7893,Hi its me Lucas
epicgamer#7893,Hi its me Lucas
epicgamer#7893,Hi its me Lucas
epicgamer#7893,Hi its me Lucas
karthiccc#0069,ok ill get rid of this
karthiccc#0069,message
J-Klar#4158,ok
J-Klar#4158,can u assign it commands like how most do with prefixes
J-Klar#4158,eg !play
J-Klar#4158,?
BlazeThief#4311,Jake does !play
BlazeThief#4311,The bot replies
BlazeThief#4311,No
J-Klar#4158,D:
karthiccc#0069,so prefix eg is what we going for?
karthiccc#0069,im tryna make it run on a remote host rn
karthiccc#0069,then add more features
J-Klar#4158,You could integrate it to send patch notes
J-Klar#4158,When they get released
BlazeThief#4311,You can make it send sheesh
J-Klar#4158,you could have it send the current weekly skin discounts
BlazeThief#4311,You can make it send sheesh
J-Klar#4158,you can make it send sheesh
J-Klar#4158,could also make it return reccomend build
J-Klar#4158,for a champ
karthiccc#0069,yoioooopooooo
karthiccc#0069,it works offline now
karthiccc#0069,poggggggg
J-Klar#4158,what is it hosted on
karthiccc#0069,and sure those are actually not bad ideas
karthiccc#0069,heroku
J-Klar#4158,o never heard of it
karthiccc#0069,japanese based thing I believe
J-Klar#4158,What is its current functionality
karthiccc#0069,its baller
karthiccc#0069,and only good free one
karthiccc#0069,only functionality is the chewsday thing
J-Klar#4158,aight
epicgamer#7893,Hi its me Lucas
karthiccc#0069,huh ok
karthiccc#0069,so i can still make changes and run it on my computer
karthiccc#0069,interesting
karthiccc#0069,very cool stuff
BlazeThief#4311,Sheesh they got them gaming keyboards in loki
karthiccc#0069,sheeesh
BlazeThief#4311,why is it a file bruh
karthiccc#0069,ok first command probably gonna be sheesh
karthiccc#0069,"""everytime you say it"
BlazeThief#4311,Lets go
karthiccc#0069,merak send sheesh gif
J-Klar#4158,How would it do that
J-Klar#4158,You can't edit other peoples messages
J-Klar#4158,for obvious reasons
karthiccc#0069,no but it will delete the message that says sheesh
karthiccc#0069,and send the gif immediately
karthiccc#0069,so more like a delete and replace
J-Klar#4158,o lol
Pizzanat#6176,but then it would no longer be our reactions
Pizzanat#6176,the bot is taking over our conversations
karthiccc#0069,ight then i wont delete the message
Pizzanat#6176,now it is one of the boiiisss reacting with one of the boiiisssss
karthiccc#0069,sheesh
karthiccc#0069,um
karthiccc#0069,sheesh
J-Klar#4158,unlucky
karthiccc#0069,it works in my test server
karthiccc#0069,but not here...
karthiccc#0069,sheehs
karthiccc#0069,sheesh
karthiccc#0069,jasper did you do anything with the perms for this?
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat
Pizzanat#6176,let me check
Pizzanat#6176,sheesh
Pizzanat#6176,found the problem
Pizzanat#6176,:D
Pizzanat#6176,"""sheesh"
Pizzanat#6176,but it works now
Pizzanat#6176,sheesh
BlazeThief#4311,Sheesh
BlazeThief#4311,sheesh
BlazeThief#4311,Bruh
karthiccc#0069,oh ill fix the caps thing
BlazeThief#4311,Gotta make it more customizable
karthiccc#0069,i will
BlazeThief#4311,I gotta be able to say sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
BlazeThief#4311,and it will show up
karthiccc#0069,yeye give me 10 mins for that
BlazeThief#4311,aight bossman
Pizzanat#6176,and also if we use the original gif
Pizzanat#6176,it should double it :D
karthiccc#0069,right right
J-Klar#4158,sheesh
karthiccc#0069,ill do that too
J-Klar#4158,D:
Pizzanat#6176,sheesh
karthiccc#0069,turned bot off
Pizzanat#6176,you stopped it
Pizzanat#6176,D:
karthiccc#0069,working on it
karthiccc#0069,"""or the """"updated"""" one i should say"""
J-Klar#4158,honestly if i dont go to school this year I might reconsider what I want to go for
karthiccc#0069,thats good
karthiccc#0069,actually do something more interesting
karthiccc#0069,or you're more interested in
J-Klar#4158,yeah like i like cs
J-Klar#4158,but im not hyper passionate
J-Klar#4158,about it

epicgamer#7893,yes
Lucаs#7263,guess i'm eating karthiks moms ass
epicgamer#7893,you're a twat
J-Klar#4158,^
karthiccc#0069,did any of you guys do 8a on 309?
Lucаs#7263,why
Lucаs#7263,deosnt look too hard
karthiccc#0069,yeah but I know i fucked up
karthiccc#0069,somewhere
karthiccc#0069,and can't find it
Lucаs#7263,ight imma do it
karthiccc#0069,oh wait nvm
karthiccc#0069,found my problem
karthiccc#0069,im dumb
Lucаs#7263,yeah
Lucаs#7263,ight karthik did you get 0 0 0 -16?
Lucаs#7263,think i may have made the same mistake
Lucаs#7263,i am dumb
karthiccc#0069,"""nah i got a point like (23/2"
karthiccc#0069,i don't know what you did wrong
Lucаs#7263,breuv
karthiccc#0069,um lucas
Lucаs#7263,whats good
karthiccc#0069,i know what you did wrong
Lucаs#7263,le
karthiccc#0069,-5 + 5(1/5) right?
Lucаs#7263,ye
karthiccc#0069,its -4
karthiccc#0069,not 0
Lucаs#7263,adrghadrhardeh
Lucаs#7263,how
karthiccc#0069,0 0 -4 | -16
karthiccc#0069,5(1/5) = 1
karthiccc#0069,-5 + 1
karthiccc#0069,-4
Lucаs#7263,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
karthiccc#0069,yeah i aint gonna lie
karthiccc#0069,im never gonna use mental math for this shit
karthiccc#0069,imma put every little thing in my calculator
Lucаs#7263,seriously sketchy
karthiccc#0069,fax
Lucаs#7263,i gotta get a calculator mod that just does this for me
karthiccc#0069,i feel like there is
karthiccc#0069,like I found out recently that we have a derivative function
karthiccc#0069,on our calcs
Lucаs#7263,whattt
Lucаs#7263,how
karthiccc#0069,so there gotta be other shit
Lucаs#7263,bruvvv
karthiccc#0069,d/dx
Lucаs#7263,how do u use it doe
karthiccc#0069,you put in the equation you want the derivative of
karthiccc#0069,and an x value
karthiccc#0069,"""thats the only thing"
Lucаs#7263,ahh
Lucаs#7263,so not too usefull still
Lucаs#7263,good for chekcing thoi
karthiccc#0069,ye for checking it is useful
karthiccc#0069,so i feel like i could find a poi func in here too
Lucаs#7263,feel like you would need a ghraphing calc for that
karthiccc#0069,fair point
karthiccc#0069,but those are expensive af
karthiccc#0069,don't think we'll ever use it either
Lucаs#7263,why not?
karthiccc#0069,not allowed in most exams
Lucаs#7263,wack
karthiccc#0069,ye
epicgamer#7893,bing bong ching chong I want some ling shlong
Lucаs#7263,Ling from fma
karthiccc#0069,never watched fma
karthiccc#0069,still need to
Lucаs#7263,It’s aight I would say there better stuff to watch doe
karthiccc#0069,hmmmm ight
karthiccc#0069,further back in the watchlist it goes
Lucаs#7263,Masterpiece the animation should be no1
karthiccc#0069,any of you done 9 on 309?
J-Klar#4158,These arent parallel right?
J-Klar#4158,just a bit of tom foolery
Lucаs#7263,no
J-Klar#4158,pog
J-Klar#4158,What are you supposed to do when they are parallel
Lucаs#7263,determine what kind of situation it is
Lucаs#7263,4 paralell possibilities
J-Klar#4158,do you not have to actually give an answer tho?
J-Klar#4158,like you legit just vibe
Lucаs#7263,bruh
Lucаs#7263,note
Lucаs#7263,u gotta
J-Klar#4158,yeah but
Lucаs#7263,if its one of them
J-Klar#4158,none
J-Klar#4158,of
Lucаs#7263,situation 2
J-Klar#4158,the examples
J-Klar#4158,had that
Lucаs#7263,2 coincident planes intersect with another creating a line
Lucаs#7263,so you would give as line as answer
J-Klar#4158,yeah i get that
Lucаs#7263,if its the other ones then you just say no soln cuz theres no sol and state which situation it is
Lucаs#7263,so it depends
Lucаs#7263,on which kind of situation it is
J-Klar#4158,ye but do u always out it in a matrix
J-Klar#4158,the planes that is
J-Klar#4158,then the answer from that would help you determine the type
J-Klar#4158,if it isn't just a point or a line
Lucаs#7263,not sure if he wants you to to specifically say which type he wants or just say no common interrsection
J-Klar#4158,so u do always put them in the matrix
Lucаs#7263,no
J-Klar#4158,but the only time you wouldnt is if you could see that they were all parallel
Lucаs#7263,"""not all of them"
Lucаs#7263,he told us which ones to use a matrix on
J-Klar#4158,yeah but i dont get what you are meant to do if you dont use matrix do u legit just say the type
Lucаs#7263,well yeah ebcause solving hte matrix wouldnt give a solution
Lucаs#7263,so you just state the type
Lucаs#7263,and say no soln
Lucаs#7263,unless its situation 2
karthiccc#0069,wait so how do you tell the difference between coincident and parallel?
Lucаs#7263,Don’t think you need to
karthiccc#0069,because both are just goin to have normals that are scalar multiples of eachother
karthiccc#0069,well i mean how would you tell the difference between 3 parallel distinct planes and 2 coincident and 1 disctinct?
karthiccc#0069,when saying what type they are
J-Klar#4158,good poinr
Lucаs#7263,3 parallel and distinct has no soln 3 coincident has a soln
J-Klar#4158,so u have to use a matrix
karthiccc#0069,yeah then what about 2 coincident and 1 distinct
karthiccc#0069,dang so you have to use the matrix to determine
Lucаs#7263,2co 1dis is situation 4 no sol
karthiccc#0069,feels bad
karthiccc#0069,wait didn;t he say if there is no solution you have to state what type?
J-Klar#4158,this is so confusing
karthiccc#0069,so like i know its no solution
karthiccc#0069,but which one
karthiccc#0069,you feel me?
Lucаs#7263,look at it this way
Lucаs#7263,just use a matrix no matter what
karthiccc#0069,im just tryna figure out if there was a way to know or do I just have to use matrix;s cuase he said for parallel ones you don't need to do matrix
Lucаs#7263,you dont have to
Lucаs#7263,but may as well
Lucаs#7263,\i think
karthiccc#0069,man this some wack shit
J-Klar#4158,what did you guys get for 7 on 309
karthiccc#0069,"""(27/4"
Lucаs#7263,"""if you use a matrix and get no soln then you can rule out all options other than situation 4"
J-Klar#4158,bruh i keep getting one answer right
J-Klar#4158,and the other two not its so strange
karthiccc#0069,wait tho lucas
karthiccc#0069,that still won't tell you tho
karthiccc#0069,because the matrix will say no solution for both coincident and parallel
J-Klar#4158,ye but if they coincident surely the n would be the same
karthiccc#0069,and the normal will say the same that they are parallel cuz a coincident is parallel (technically)
karthiccc#0069,not necessarily
Lucаs#7263,ight man join call this annoying to type?
karthiccc#0069,yeah
maximumeffort1#3058,man that shits wack
J-Klar#4158,matrices
J-Klar#4158,htey're not actually hard

karthiccc#0069,yo jake you do 13 from the review?
karthiccc#0069,on pg 312
J-Klar#4158,i did the first page
J-Klar#4158,like first set of questions
J-Klar#4158,only
J-Klar#4158,was tha t
J-Klar#4158,part of it
J-Klar#4158,i forget
karthiccc#0069,ye there is another page
J-Klar#4158,no i mean
J-Klar#4158,is that question part of the first page
J-Klar#4158,cuz thats all i did
J-Klar#4158,so far
J-Klar#4158,doing the rest later / tmrw
karthiccc#0069,nah not first page
karthiccc#0069,its second page
J-Klar#4158,then no
J-Klar#4158,wtf is that question
J-Klar#4158,oh wait im dumb nvm
J-Klar#4158,what did u want to know thiccums'

Pizzanat#6176,t = 1/5
karthiccc#0069,wat
karthiccc#0069,how
Pizzanat#6176,what did you do?
karthiccc#0069,"""the direction for the normal is (4"
Pizzanat#6176,yes
karthiccc#0069,"""and so the equation for the line is r = t(4"

karthiccc#0069,"""ok so x = 4t"
Pizzanat#6176,yes
Pizzanat#6176,so did you add something wrong?
J-Klar#4158,"""i got 4/5"

J-Klar#4158,as the poi
Pizzanat#6176,ye same
J-Klar#4158,pog
karthiccc#0069,4(4t) - 2(2t) + 5(5t) - 9 = 0

BlazeThief#4311,"""Why is your name """"call me demon"""" karthik?"""
BlazeThief#4311,Ohhh
J-Klar#4158,is there a reason that the text book doesn't include points in its vector form for planes?
J-Klar#4158,or is it just stupid
Lucаs#7263,they use cartesian right?
Lucаs#7263,or what are you talking about
J-Klar#4158,no even when they give vector answers they legit only include the d values
J-Klar#4158,no point
J-Klar#4158,I think its because they have the parametric after
J-Klar#4158,which indicates the point
karthiccc#0069,or the point is the origin?
J-Klar#4158,no it isn't
J-Klar#4158,not for the question at least
J-Klar#4158,pre sure its just because its included in the parametric
J-Klar#4158,so its like implied
J-Klar#4158,but its wack
J-Klar#4158,and ugly
J-Klar#4158,and me no like
J-Klar#4158,damn i was uspposed to just do the second page tmrw but i just power gamed and speed ran it
J-Klar#4158,just have to do all these matrices
J-Klar#4158,thats the only thing im not 100% confident on
karthiccc#0069,its fine
karthiccc#0069,this test i feel gonna be easier than last one
J-Klar#4158,ye not worried literally just need to figure out which scenario is which for the matrices when it isn't a point
J-Klar#4158,thats all
J-Klar#4158,i cant wiat to have the weirdest test scores of all times
J-Klar#4158,finna have 3 high 90s a 70 and 2 mid 60s lmao

Lucаs#7263,yeah i know man its pretty lit
Lucаs#7263,Will literally tell you this too
Lucаs#7263,@karthiccc the wack no9 wont be on the test
Lucаs#7263,he said himself
Aho#7784,"""okay really stupid question but when I was doing the review"
J-Klar#4158,same d value(s)
Aho#7784,so dont change the d values?
Aho#7784,or can it be a scalar multiple?
karthiccc#0069,@Lucаs holy
karthiccc#0069,so it does exist
karthiccc#0069,but only for 3 points im guessing eh?
Lucаs#7263,yeye you can do matrix calculationsand vectore stuff too
Lucаs#7263,wdym
karthiccc#0069,wait whats the function
karthiccc#0069,imma play around wit it
Lucаs#7263,complicated
Lucаs#7263,you gotta
Lucаs#7263,wait
Lucаs#7263,which one vector or matrix
karthiccc#0069,matrix
Lucаs#7263,its not actually matrix press mode then equation then 2
Lucаs#7263,its just solving system of equations
Aho#7784,"""I'm confused"
Lucаs#7263,good for checking answers
Lucаs#7263,and the vector one is really good for doing cross product
karthiccc#0069,damn
karthiccc#0069,calculators kinda vibin
Lucаs#7263,fr
J-Klar#4158,truers
Lucаs#7263,they even have a quadratic one which woulda helped the last few years
Lucаs#7263,gives real and non real roots
karthiccc#0069,i knew about the quadratic one
Aho#7784,Can anyone help me with 2b and c on 266?
karthiccc#0069,just never realized the one below was matrix's
karthiccc#0069,and sure jordan one sec
J-Klar#4158,ye jordan
J-Klar#4158,you have one d value from tha tline given
karthiccc#0069,can you send pic of question
J-Klar#4158,and you have a point
J-Klar#4158,and you have the point from the other line
karthiccc#0069,oh its the review question
J-Klar#4158,you dont even need that point tho
J-Klar#4158,its just the d value from the line given
J-Klar#4158,and the point given
karthiccc#0069,oh yeah the answer in the textbook is wack for that one
karthiccc#0069,"""its has t(1"
J-Klar#4158,"""r = (-5"

J-Klar#4158,its wacko
karthiccc#0069,ye textbook a sketch lad
Aho#7784,so 2c?
J-Klar#4158,the d is the coefficents
J-Klar#4158,of the line given
karthiccc#0069,so for perpendicular you need the normal right
J-Klar#4158,and you ahve the points
karthiccc#0069,the normal is the coefficients of that equation
Aho#7784,yeah but how do you get the normal when you cant cross multiply
Lucаs#7263,the normal is the coefficents of variables
J-Klar#4158,its the coefficents in scalar form
karthiccc#0069,thats for planes mate
Lucаs#7263,ax + by
J-Klar#4158,cross product is for planes only

karthiccc#0069,Friday we lose jake and Saturday we lose jordan
J-Klar#4158,so fri then
BlazeThief#4311,Though Jasper hasn't said if he can do friday
BlazeThief#4311,And depending on how hard vaccine be hitting could be losing me on friday
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat
karthiccc#0069,So we gotta decide
karthiccc#0069,!vote friday
karthiccc#0069,!vote saturday
karthiccc#0069,Ight well it seems we lose 2 people friday potentially
BlazeThief#4311,Saturday may be the only day available though
BlazeThief#4311,Since Lucas hasn't asked his uncle about friday
BlazeThief#4311,Unless he has
Pizzanat#6176,No updates from L man yet
karthiccc#0069,he working rn
karthiccc#0069,so i mean
BlazeThief#4311,yeeeee
BlazeThief#4311,We just gotta wait
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeeesh
BlazeThief#4311,Might rain
karthiccc#0069,its been saying that for everyday since like spring started
karthiccc#0069,weather always gonna be wack
Pizzanat#6176,swimming in the rain is more fun
karthiccc#0069,that too
BlazeThief#4311,Swimming in thunderstorm
BlazeThief#4311,See who dies first
karthiccc#0069,the tallest get struck first
karthiccc#0069,im safe
Pizzanat#6176,not if you hide under the water!
Pizzanat#6176,wait......
BlazeThief#4311,Well I guess if one of us gets struck
BlazeThief#4311,The lightning bolt would just get a multi kill
BlazeThief#4311,From the water
Pizzanat#6176,what if we all absorb the energy equally and magically share the powers of thor
BlazeThief#4311,Thats the plot of thor love and thunder
BlazeThief#4311,All of us are thor
Lucаs#7263,Aight let’s say Friday as long as it’s good with everyone
Lucаs#7263,Less rain chance too so that counts for something
karthiccc#0069,wouldn't it be Saturday because more people could come?
Pizzanat#6176,so what we doing then? Friday or Saturday?
BlazeThief#4311,so what we doing then? Friday or Saturday?
karthiccc#0069,so what we doing then? Friday or Saturday?
epicgamer#7893,so what we doing then? Friday or Saturday?
Lucаs#7263,Who can’t cum on Friday
J-Klar#4158,me
BlazeThief#4311,Jake
BlazeThief#4311,And possibly me if wackness
BlazeThief#4311,But I feel chill rn

Pizzanat#6176,oof for jordan tho
Pizzanat#6176,but i ok with anything
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah sadgeness
BlazeThief#4311,Though he said he didn't wanna swim as well
BlazeThief#4311,Although I'm not sure how much we gonna swim if we can
BlazeThief#4311,Are you swim jasper?
Pizzanat#6176,maybe
Pizzanat#6176,i'll bring stuff
Pizzanat#6176,but we'll decide when we get there i guess
BlazeThief#4311,True
BlazeThief#4311,If we get there and there is a poo floating around in lucas's green pool
BlazeThief#4311,Then we good to go
BlazeThief#4311,but if it has clear water then we probably shouldn't swim
Pizzanat#6176,yes
Pizzanat#6176,clear water means too much chlorine
Pizzanat#6176,probably unsafe
Lucаs#7263,I’ll make sure to dump in it beforehand then
Aho#7784,Dont yall love a 7/21 bot lane?
karthiccc#0069,haha yup
karthiccc#0069,especially when they in my ranked games
Aho#7784,So umm we lost.... just because Hullbreaker is a item
Aho#7784,legit Yorick pushed into tier 2 towers in 20 min
Aho#7784,and pushed based in 30 with both of the nexus towers gone
Aho#7784,because hullbreaker made him tanky asf
Aho#7784,yay love this game
Aho#7784,gn
karthiccc#0069,we out boys
J-Klar#4158,POG
J-Klar#4158,HUGE POG
J-Klar#4158,whatever u do

J-Klar#4158,Gotta love the huge Mcdonalds ad in weathering with you
J-Klar#4158,also the art style / quality is amazing in this
J-Klar#4158,what in the world is this lil player lmao
J-Klar#4158,twas poggers
J-Klar#4158,but I dont get why the sun comes out at the end
J-Klar#4158,if neither of them sacrificed themselves
J-Klar#4158,was she just part way through it?
karthiccc#0069,Tbh i don't remember enough of the ending to answer that
BlazeThief#4311,I forget were they even together at the end?
karthiccc#0069,Thought my mans went to jail
BlazeThief#4311,Didn't the world legit end
maximumeffort1#3058,Yo have any of you gamers watched/read berserk?
Lucаs#7263,no
Aho#7784,Like the anime???
maximumeffort1#3058,Or read the manga
BlazeThief#4311,Read it if you do
Aho#7784,I heard the manga was great
BlazeThief#4311,Everything I have seen is people say anime is awful
Aho#7784,Watched the anime and didn’t like it
karthiccc#0069,read a couple chapters
karthiccc#0069,haven't read much tho
maximumeffort1#3058,Me too that’s why I’m curious
BlazeThief#4311,"""Legit the number 1 manga on mal"
karthiccc#0069,its really good
karthiccc#0069,but has no ending
karthiccc#0069,main author died right?
Lucаs#7263,the best ones always do
BlazeThief#4311,I think there was talk of assistance for it possibly continuing it
BlazeThief#4311,not sure how true that is though
karthiccc#0069,yeah but in that sense there is a possibility of them fucking it up
karthiccc#0069,who knows
karthiccc#0069,anyway kyle read vagabond
BlazeThief#4311,Bruh
maximumeffort1#3058,What’s vagabond
Lucаs#7263,vinland
BlazeThief#4311,How much of that have you even read karthik
karthiccc#0069,samurai boys
karthiccc#0069,vibin and survivin
maximumeffort1#3058,Is there like a funny sight where I can read for freeeee
BlazeThief#4311,mangadex
maximumeffort1#3058,Noted
BlazeThief#4311,Though its in a beta thing right now
BlazeThief#4311,Since they got hacked and destroyed
karthiccc#0069,mangakakalot or somethin
BlazeThief#4311,a few months ago
Aho#7784,I use manga rock pro on iPhone
BlazeThief#4311,I don't think things get updated on it
BlazeThief#4311,since its still in beta
BlazeThief#4311,but since berserks last chapter was probably before it went down
BlazeThief#4311,you should be chill
BlazeThief#4311,I think they have a mobile thing as well
BlazeThief#4311,not sure
maximumeffort1#3058,Ight lads thanks
J-Klar#4158,Nah man he breaks out of the jail and ascends again and finds her
J-Klar#4158,Also is there like a reason that the movie feels so episodic
BlazeThief#4311,Wait did you watch your name jake?
BlazeThief#4311,Since its sorta a prequel to weathering with you
J-Klar#4158,I didn't
J-Klar#4158,Watching that tonight
BlazeThief#4311,The two main characters in that one show up for a bit in weathering with you from what I remember
BlazeThief#4311,Though I think they are very very minor
maximumeffort1#3058,Wow ok the first fucking page of chapter 1 the main guy is literally fucking a monster
karthiccc#0069,@Pizzanat add jake to the amines
BlazeThief#4311,!vote Thoughts on changing the name from degenerates?
Lucаs#7263,merak dont even vote for himself
Pizzanat#6176,I think it is useless anyways since i checked the permissions and it isn't even used for anything
Pizzanat#6176,So there should also be:
Pizzanat#6176,!vote delete the role?
BlazeThief#4311,Can we still access amines though?
Pizzanat#6176,Yes
Pizzanat#6176,I apparently didn't even set it to do anything
BlazeThief#4311,So its just there to be toxic to us
Pizzanat#6176,I just changed the permissions of people individually
Pizzanat#6176,Well it wasn't my idea to make it that
BlazeThief#4311,True
Pizzanat#6176,So i guess deleting it it is?
BlazeThief#4311,I guess so
Pizzanat#6176,And apparently kyle is now the only one not in it

J-Klar#4158,or is it just their school cuz its so 'prestige'
J-Klar#4158,highschool btw
karthiccc#0069,i guess all highschools do it?
karthiccc#0069,in japan
J-Klar#4158,blev
J-Klar#4158,kinda weird
karthiccc#0069,at least in the shows ive watched they do
J-Klar#4158,and innapropriate
karthiccc#0069,ranking students isn't really unordinary
karthiccc#0069,don't they do that in england?
J-Klar#4158,no
J-Klar#4158,thats really weird
J-Klar#4158,and dehumanizing
J-Klar#4158,I don't think they should do that
karthiccc#0069,a lot of countries do that
karthiccc#0069,some schools in the states do
J-Klar#4158,well not here or england
J-Klar#4158,so
karthiccc#0069,well im pretty sure all asian countries do
J-Klar#4158,wack
karthiccc#0069,¯\_(ツ)_/¯

karthiccc#0069,I dont know how tf my i typef that but
karthiccc#0069,Jujutsu kaisen
J-Klar#4158,ah
J-Klar#4158,yeah no
karthiccc#0069,My keyboard wack as hell on mobile
J-Klar#4158,hard pass
J-Klar#4158,maybe one day
J-Klar#4158,but rn im into shows that make me emotionally confused apparently
karthiccc#0069,Uh huh
karthiccc#0069,Well then
J-Klar#4158,what do you not feel the same way?
karthiccc#0069,I can agree they are very nice
karthiccc#0069,But not too many of them that are good
karthiccc#0069,Ight jake watch bunny girl senpai now
karthiccc#0069,Trust its about quantum physics
J-Klar#4158,To be honest I think I'm just watching them in hopes to have an emotional epiphany
karthiccc#0069,I feel that
karthiccc#0069,But it never happens
J-Klar#4158,It just makes me feel insignifcant
karthiccc#0069,Yeah exactly
J-Klar#4158,Nothing interesting has really ever happened in our lives
J-Klar#4158,I've never had a friend die
J-Klar#4158,or overcome my social anxiety
karthiccc#0069,Or swapped bodies with a girl from the country
J-Klar#4158,or found someone and fell in love
J-Klar#4158,i don't really think I've ever improved as a person. not a me problem to be fair I figure everyone feels the same way
karthiccc#0069,Meh i think ive changed as a person
J-Klar#4158,ok well yeah
karthiccc#0069,Whether i improved or not is not up to me
J-Klar#4158,I didn't mean not like at all
J-Klar#4158,I personally think I'm a much better person than I was 4 years ago
karthiccc#0069,Well then there ya go
karthiccc#0069,Improvement
J-Klar#4158,I guess. It's so easy to dismiss any accomplishments
karthiccc#0069,We tend to think about the negatives rather than the positives
J-Klar#4158,Yup
J-Klar#4158,Serious question do you ever get worried that you'll die unhappy and unfufilled?
karthiccc#0069,Didnt we talk about this before
J-Klar#4158,Probably a while ago
karthiccc#0069,Then i guess ill stick with my previous answer
J-Klar#4158,It's been on my mind for years now
karthiccc#0069,Yes i am worried
karthiccc#0069,Im still a virgin
karthiccc#0069,Id at least rather die after that
J-Klar#4158,I could help with that
karthiccc#0069,But for real tho i dont think id be too sad to die this moment
karthiccc#0069,Not like ive gained much but it aint on a bad note
karthiccc#0069,Aint a peak in my life but neither a low
J-Klar#4158,I would be sad to die now
J-Klar#4158,I don't really feel like I've lived
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah bruh
karthiccc#0069,Yeah i get that but tbh death is kinda peaceful so as long as it aint in a brutal csr crash or anything
karthiccc#0069,I dont mind
BlazeThief#4311,You like ending the game after the tutorial
BlazeThief#4311,or before it even ends
J-Klar#4158,I just want to definitivley say that i am happy
karthiccc#0069,Maybe there is a better game to play?
BlazeThief#4311,Nah
J-Klar#4158,I feel like I used to be happy
J-Klar#4158,when i was younger
karthiccc#0069,Are you sad rn?
J-Klar#4158,its not that im sad
J-Klar#4158,i get sad often
J-Klar#4158,but just in general
J-Klar#4158,no
J-Klar#4158,im just not happy
J-Klar#4158,either
BlazeThief#4311,Do you get happy though
karthiccc#0069,Yeah i feel that
karthiccc#0069,And thats ight tho
J-Klar#4158,well yeah I get happy a lot
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeeesh
J-Klar#4158,like when im playing with you guys or doing whatever
karthiccc#0069,Dont gotta always be happy as long as u get haopy at times then its fine
J-Klar#4158,but its not true happiness you know
karthiccc#0069,Damn
BlazeThief#4311,Bruv what is true happiness
karthiccc#0069,Whats true happiness?
BlazeThief#4311,Is it like
BlazeThief#4311,I just manamune
BlazeThief#4311,but true happiness is muramana
karthiccc#0069,Sheesh
karthiccc#0069,Merak with the analogies
J-Klar#4158,I don't really know
J-Klar#4158,but I don't feel like I have it
J-Klar#4158,and at the end of the day isn't that evidence enough
karthiccc#0069,For me i think im peak happy when vibin with the boys or family
karthiccc#0069,Dont gotta be anything too special
BlazeThief#4311,I think I feel both peak happy and depressed in both situations
J-Klar#4158,maybe pancreas lady is right then its just about your relationships
J-Klar#4158,which sucks to hear as somebody who is terrified of people
karthiccc#0069,Wym terrified of people
karthiccc#0069,Social anxiety?
J-Klar#4158,Crippling
BlazeThief#4311,Social anxiety gang rise up
karthiccc#0069,I mean its something you can work on fixing
J-Klar#4158,I have a need to hold my breath when I walk past strangers
BlazeThief#4311,Physically can't eat food outside of the house gang rise up
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah I have that breath thing too
J-Klar#4158,its aids
BlazeThief#4311,I also feel like people think I'm smelling them or something
BlazeThief#4311,But then I look even more sketch
karthiccc#0069,What
karthiccc#0069,You smelling them?
BlazeThief#4311,How would I be smelling them If I don't breath?
J-Klar#4158,i mean i get that. i feel that im breathing too loud
J-Klar#4158,thats why I hold my breath
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah honestly
BlazeThief#4311,I think Imma just hit em with it
J-Klar#4158,except then I've arrived to class with a literal pounding heart and have to slowly and silently recover
BlazeThief#4311,Thats me
J-Klar#4158,because if I started catching breath
J-Klar#4158,its hyper doomed
J-Klar#4158,cuz them im a weird freak
BlazeThief#4311,The crowded halls at school
J-Klar#4158,im fine when I walk with friends
J-Klar#4158,but its when im alone
karthiccc#0069,Do you feel like that when your alone with strangers or efen when u have a familiar person nearby
karthiccc#0069,Oh
J-Klar#4158,no just strangers
karthiccc#0069,Gotcha

BlazeThief#4311,Legit like a parasite
J-Klar#4158,im also super scared of never finding like

BlazeThief#4311,Fragmeister

J-Klar#4158,wasnt before friendo
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah we are very isolated
BlazeThief#4311,Not sure about you guys
karthiccc#0069,But once you start going to uni  n shit
BlazeThief#4311,But I legit talk to no one else but you guys
karthiccc#0069,Getting exposed to more peolle
J-Klar#4158,i still wont be tho karthik
karthiccc#0069,How

karthiccc#0069,Evwryone i know says it all the time
karthiccc#0069,You'll meet the wildest and interesting people
karthiccc#0069,Because its not always you who'll start the conversation
J-Klar#4158,God I wish I wasn't ginger I fucking despise it
BlazeThief#4311,Bruh WHAT
karthiccc#0069,Ok now your just hating on your hair
karthiccc#0069,I dont wven get why
BlazeThief#4311,GInger hair is legit chad
BlazeThief#4311,Like my hair is litterally the most generic thing on earth
J-Klar#4158,well its why I ended up this way. All through primary school i never even thought twice about it
karthiccc#0069,People dye their hair orange to be fake gingwr
J-Klar#4158,then i just get bullied for a year straight
J-Klar#4158,and now for no reaosn I live with social anxiety
J-Klar#4158,and have a boredline hatred for who I am
J-Klar#4158,not really fair
BlazeThief#4311,I doubt people in uni in 2023 gonna be toxic about your hair though
karthiccc#0069,Yeah
BlazeThief#4311,Though past stuff I see coming into play
karthiccc#0069,If people considwr there being 72+ genders
J-Klar#4158,so then I try to justify it being fair by thinking im a bad person
J-Klar#4158,and that i deserve it
karthiccc#0069,No one gonna hate on the hair
J-Klar#4158,then i feel bad about feeling bad bcuz others have a life much harder than mine
BlazeThief#4311,Bruh
BlazeThief#4311,THis like hjarry potter
BlazeThief#4311,He was like
BlazeThief#4311,I think I am becoming bad
karthiccc#0069,Overthinking it a bit too much jake
BlazeThief#4311,And sirius black the chad
BlazeThief#4311,Said
BlazeThief#4311,You aren't bad
BlazeThief#4311,just have had bad things happen
J-Klar#4158,probably but I cant stop thinking that much
BlazeThief#4311,Its liek that
BlazeThief#4311,Though
J-Klar#4158,No I don't think im a bad person
BlazeThief#4311,The whole other people have bad things happen
J-Klar#4158,not a perfect person
BlazeThief#4311,Is a bad mind set
J-Klar#4158,but im not a bad person
J-Klar#4158,but its just hard
BlazeThief#4311,Imo
karthiccc#0069,Thoughr you just said you were a bad person
karthiccc#0069,Now im confused
J-Klar#4158,Its just a fleeting thought
karthiccc#0069,So u believe or not believe u are bad
J-Klar#4158,well no obviously im not hitler. I was just saying sometimes i think that as a justification for why I feel so shit
karthiccc#0069,Uh huh
karthiccc#0069,Isnt it more of an excuse then?
J-Klar#4158,how can u have an excuse for something you dont want to happen
karthiccc#0069,Yeah nvm im just retarded
BlazeThief#4311,Though
BlazeThief#4311,Could it just be like
BlazeThief#4311,You trying to pin it exactly
BlazeThief#4311,But its not exactly correct
BlazeThief#4311,or am I just reading this wrong
J-Klar#4158,I don't understand what you're trynna say
BlazeThief#4311,Like you are trying to find a reason
BlazeThief#4311,So you think that one is understandable
karthiccc#0069,To feel like shit?
J-Klar#4158,no i was just saying that sometimes i think thats why I feel bad things happen to me
J-Klar#4158,it wasn't meant to be a big thing
J-Klar#4158,I was just saying that instead of life being unfair
J-Klar#4158,maybe thats a reason
BlazeThief#4311,Eh I think life is just unfair
karthiccc#0069,Life was never fair
J-Klar#4158,lost to a coinflip feelsbadman
karthiccc#0069,!rand heads tails
epicgamer#7893,heads

BlazeThief#4311,unlucky
BlazeThief#4311,Though chadmeister
BlazeThief#4311,I think that
karthiccc#0069,Sometimes i just feel like i annoy people too much with my stupidity that i want to die
BlazeThief#4311,If you go to uni and actually are open to talking to peeps although it may be wackness to do so I ain't full sure since I wack
BlazeThief#4311,Then
BlazeThief#4311,You chill
J-Klar#4158,well its more than just talking to people
BlazeThief#4311,Cause if some dude walks up and is like whats up
BlazeThief#4311,and you just are like
J-Klar#4158,well obviously not gonna do that
J-Klar#4158,will have a conversation
karthiccc#0069,Then you shoyuld be fine
karthiccc#0069,Ill bet you money
J-Klar#4158,Think you missed the whole point of this
karthiccc#0069,You'll have someone walk up to u
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah just get all the words I say out of your head before
J-Klar#4158,Was never saying that I was worried about talking to people in university
BlazeThief#4311,Then you should be chill
BlazeThief#4311,You meet peeps
BlazeThief#4311,you talk
J-Klar#4158,was talking about how im just sadge
karthiccc#0069,Werent you saying your worried about finding the one?
J-Klar#4158,consto
BlazeThief#4311,You say have you watched my favourite anime jujutsu kaisen
BlazeThief#4311,Then show them your are challenger in league
BlazeThief#4311,then best friends
karthiccc#0069,You say your sadge bur you havent said why
J-Klar#4158,I feel like I have
karthiccc#0069,Or have u

karthiccc#0069,Maybe a recap cuz i forgot
BlazeThief#4311,We may have pulled a jordan here karthik
karthiccc#0069,Most definitely
karthiccc#0069,But my memory shit anyway
BlazeThief#4311,We need that recap episode
karthiccc#0069,.5 episode jake plez
BlazeThief#4311,Or we could
BlazeThief#4311,Just scroll
J-Klar#4158,1) Feel my life has been empty and pointless 2) Feel guilty about feeling bad 3) Have issues even walking past strangers 4) Not really the best at anything 5) Unattractive
J-Klar#4158,just sadgeness
BlazeThief#4311,Though do you have anything you want to pursue
BlazeThief#4311,Or is it kinda just like I guess I'll do that
J-Klar#4158,i mean i like writing
J-Klar#4158,not relaly much money in that though
BlazeThief#4311,So during your gap year right some
karthiccc#0069,"""Yeah the """"not really the best at anything"""" is something you can always work on"""
J-Klar#4158,Well I didn't mean straight up in that way
BlazeThief#4311,Though I don't anyone is really ever the best at anything
karthiccc#0069,^
J-Klar#4158,I have things I can say about all of you that make you interesting and unique and define you
BlazeThief#4311,My brother once said to me
J-Klar#4158,and then im just
J-Klar#4158,jake
BlazeThief#4311,You may never be the best
karthiccc#0069,Well theb i can say the same for u jake
BlazeThief#4311,Wait
BlazeThief#4311,No
BlazeThief#4311,He said
J-Klar#4158,like what tho
BlazeThief#4311,Something along the lines of
BlazeThief#4311,You may not be the best but you are not the worst
J-Klar#4158,so just feel bad for that sucker
BlazeThief#4311,Nahj
BlazeThief#4311,Cause if they the worse
BlazeThief#4311,it gonna take em like an hour to beat the next guy
karthiccc#0069,Mediocrity is something i believe is enjoyable
BlazeThief#4311,Though
karthiccc#0069,Since you'll have to maintain being the best
karthiccc#0069,If you were in that position
BlazeThief#4311,If you competitive

BlazeThief#4311,Pretty sure my little brother got phyzer as well
BlazeThief#4311,Unless I just going silly mode
maximumeffort1#3058,I got phyzer
maximumeffort1#3058,Mobamba is the wack one I think
Lucаs#7263,moderna is for 18+
Lucаs#7263,physer the 12-17 ting
maximumeffort1#3058,Nah physer is 18+
maximumeffort1#3058,My grand parents got physer
Lucаs#7263,its not saying that you cant get it if you are 18+
Lucаs#7263,just that it is also approved for people 12-1 7
Lucаs#7263,its just 12+ basiocally
Lucаs#7263,moderna is still 18+ only
Lucаs#7263,dont think moderna wack
BlazeThief#4311,I just remember one of them gave blood clots or something
BlazeThief#4311,But I don't even know if that one is still being used

Lucаs#7263,or at least the website says its chill
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah not sure how it be
BlazeThief#4311,Its probably chill but some people just have a bad reaction to it
BlazeThief#4311,Probably why they got a few different ones
Pizzanat#6176,"""pfizer is for under 18"
Pizzanat#6176,and moderna is only 18+
Pizzanat#6176,and my parents and my brother got moderna and i am pretty sure that one is fine still
Pizzanat#6176,pfizer and moderna are the two cool ones
Pizzanat#6176,but pfizer cooler :D
maximumeffort1#3058,Everyone spell Pfizer different
maximumeffort1#3058,But jaspers like

maximumeffort1#3058,Correct spelling
karthiccc#0069,Lucas you talking about AstraZeneca
karthiccc#0069,And they aint giving that one out anymore
karthiccc#0069,Both moderna and Pfizer are fine but Pfizer been giving people mpre headaches n shit that why its 18+
karthiccc#0069,Moderna was the better one thats why it was reserved for 17 under
karthiccc#0069,Now we have a good number of both i think so they just give out either or
Lucаs#7263,katrhik man giuve it up
Lucаs#7263,u got the little boy vaccine
Lucаs#7263,average moderna enjoyer
Pizzanat#6176,but i 17
Pizzanat#6176,clearly pfizer cooler though cuz it cooler
Lucаs#7263,i  thin kit wctually has 0.9% higher protection
karthiccc#0069,I guess they just had a ton kf Pfizer just lying around
maximumeffort1#3058,That’s just a sad man hiding behind makeup

Lucаs#7263,Yeah Jordan u have to take 1 extra course per semester in Eng
Lucаs#7263,I remember reading that
Aho#7784,only 2 classes????
karthiccc#0069,imagine needing an english credit
karthiccc#0069,pffffffffffffff
J-Klar#4158,5...
J-Klar#4158,2 e learning ones
J-Klar#4158,they show below
J-Klar#4158,not on the sched
J-Klar#4158,cuz u do whenever you like
Lucаs#7263,Not English karthik engineering
Aho#7784,This is what I got
karthiccc#0069,oh...
Lucаs#7263,Engineering requires 1 extra course per semester
J-Klar#4158,why?
Aho#7784,THis is what I wanted
Lucаs#7263,Idk they say just more shit to cover
J-Klar#4158,you still might get it jordan idk with cis they like open the spots every morning or something
J-Klar#4158,so that you can get different sections
J-Klar#4158,its weird
Aho#7784,its all full
J-Klar#4158,ye but they update them
BlazeThief#4311,That math class really messing up your mojo
J-Klar#4158,at least for cis
J-Klar#4158,i dont really get it
BlazeThief#4311,The only one before 11
J-Klar#4158,I probably wont change it tho
J-Klar#4158,i think mines fine
J-Klar#4158,the e learning ones are a god send tho
J-Klar#4158,cuz i can just do them during the cracks in the schedule
J-Klar#4158,and i have the glorious wednesday
J-Klar#4158,of nothingness
J-Klar#4158,and tbf monday is pretty much nothingness
J-Klar#4158,just one morning lecture
J-Klar#4158,so i just do that and rest of the day pog
Aho#7784,I woke up 30 min late
karthiccc#0069,probably gonna be busy Wednesday working on projects tho
Aho#7784,and all my classes were taken
J-Klar#4158,"""dude i got on and all sections for my cis program were taken"
J-Klar#4158,like rn it would be impossible for lucas to literally get any mandatory class
J-Klar#4158,but like
J-Klar#4158,it wont stay like that
J-Klar#4158,i dont understan
J-Klar#4158,dd
Aho#7784,I mean its pretty highly competitive for good times
J-Klar#4158,well yeah but literally every section
J-Klar#4158,was full
J-Klar#4158,and is right now
J-Klar#4158,so
Aho#7784,welp hes kinda fucked isnt he?
J-Klar#4158,well no cuz they were when I got on at like 8:10
J-Klar#4158,but then they are adding slots
J-Klar#4158,at like 8:30 each morning
J-Klar#4158,i think
Aho#7784,they're adding them depending on how amount of traffic they bring
Aho#7784,like for chem last night there was only like 16 classes
Aho#7784,they added 4 more classes cause it was in high demand
J-Klar#4158,its no that
J-Klar#4158,here let me tryr and find it again
J-Klar#4158,top of page
J-Klar#4158,Why is a CIS course full? Why does a CIS course have so little space?
J-Klar#4158,i dont understand this at all but ok
J-Klar#4158,wait what were your electives jordan?
Aho#7784,I dont have electives untill second year
J-Klar#4158,thats lame
J-Klar#4158,are you gonna do a minor
Aho#7784,Probably not
Aho#7784,This is a lot of work and probably dont have time to do a minor
J-Klar#4158,dude its so confusing comp sci students like have to either do a minor or something called an area of application
J-Klar#4158,its so confusing
J-Klar#4158,well a minor is just focusing most of your electives on something
J-Klar#4158,but i guess you dont have as many as me
Aho#7784,I have to do 8 wbu?
J-Klar#4158,not sure lemme check
J-Klar#4158,its so weird
J-Klar#4158,technically less than you but thats cuz i have co op
J-Klar#4158,I think you would do an Area of application if you want more freedom with the remaining electives at the trade off of not having a minor
J-Klar#4158,From reading that seems to bne the point
J-Klar#4158,because it requires less credits
J-Klar#4158,to complete
J-Klar#4158,aight minor declared
Aho#7784,I also have co-op...
J-Klar#4158,well your degree is just scuffed then feels bad man
Aho#7784,Legaue?
Aho#7784,League Jake?
J-Klar#4158,sure

J-Klar#4158,its not bad for a non epic tbh
BlazeThief#4311,Also Jordan
BlazeThief#4311,Thoughts on this
J-Klar#4158,she reminds me of the girl from Brave
BlazeThief#4311,Its just the girl from horizon zero dawn
J-Klar#4158,and a little bit of Emphys Nest from Solo
J-Klar#4158,pretty much just ginger girls
J-Klar#4158,well thats sorta weird

J-Klar#4158,whip it out at christmas
J-Klar#4158,hbring good tiding
J-Klar#4158,s
J-Klar#4158,also i kinda think gladiator is better than prime time
J-Klar#4158,it has the t1 buff
J-Klar#4158,and the music video buff
J-Klar#4158,i have 77 dh stacks on nid in a custom rn
karthiccc#0069,t1 buff and music video?
karthiccc#0069,what u mean
J-Klar#4158,Gladiator is technically the skin Draven has on in gladiator and t1 uses gladiator Draven as his pfp and he cosplahed it after coming back to twitch from his ban
karthiccc#0069,ah gotcha
BlazeThief#4311,Are you talking about awaken or is there a cinematic called gladiator
BlazeThief#4311,I'm pretty sure everything you mentioned there is just the base skin
BlazeThief#4311,Except for the cosplay
J-Klar#4158,Huh I haven't even checked but I think you're right not sure why I thought it was gladiator. Literally my memory of that thing just switched the skins right this second
BlazeThief#4311,They look hella similar I think
BlazeThief#4311,"""So can see why"
karthiccc#0069,Yo wtf the Olympics are going on?
karthiccc#0069,Thought they got canceled n shit
karthiccc#0069,And its still called Tokyo 2020!?
J-Klar#4158,not that weird
BlazeThief#4311,2021 is just 2020 2
J-Klar#4158,the eurocup was called 2020 to
BlazeThief#4311,Electric boogaloo
BlazeThief#4311,Aren't they streaming it on twitch or something
BlazeThief#4311,I saw a category for it
J-Klar#4158,not sure what you want us to see here
karthiccc#0069,discord the movie
J-Klar#4158,also not sure what the timestapm is for
karthiccc#0069,oh that was unintentional
karthiccc#0069,just wanted to send it
karthiccc#0069,forgot it sends at a specific time too
karthiccc#0069,league is a piece of shit game
Lucаs#7263,Y
Lucаs#7263,Send game stats
karthiccc#0069,nah its just the morons that play
BlazeThief#4311,@karthiccc @J-Klar @Aho You just gonna let him insult you like that
karthiccc#0069,the sound that man made is not human
BlazeThief#4311,Thought of you when I saw it
BlazeThief#4311,You and him are playing the same type of game
J-Klar#4158,Oh yeah I watched that live
karthiccc#0069,never specified what graphics settings
karthiccc#0069,probably could handle shit on literally the lowest
BlazeThief#4311,Look closer at the image my lad
Lucаs#7263,Can’t tell if it says dick chick or cock bending
karthiccc#0069,oh....
karthiccc#0069,why azula holding a rasengan?
Lucаs#7263,It’s chidori bro
Lucаs#7263,Nvm that rasengan
maximumeffort1#3058,What the flying fuck you two talking about
karthiccc#0069,your mom
J-Klar#4158,would it be weird to say that I have transcended the natural human sleeping patterns?
J-Klar#4158,I now stay awake for around 34 hours and then sleep for like 15 or 14
BlazeThief#4311,Why do you do this
J-Klar#4158,idk not tired after like 16 hours
BlazeThief#4311,Wait you doing gap year right
BlazeThief#4311,Was gonna say you gotta fix that before you start school
BlazeThief#4311,but guess not lol
J-Klar#4158,i mean not exactly like school starts soon or anything
karthiccc#0069,wait jack are you doing gap year?
karthiccc#0069,thought you said you had to wait to get PR and if you dont you won't go to school
maximumeffort1#3058,My god you need help that doesn’t sound healthy
karthiccc#0069,bruh i ran out of free hours of uptime on the bot so it wont be active for 30 days now
karthiccc#0069,sadge
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeeesh
J-Klar#4158,"""Well I don't have PR yet and the processing time puts it until after the semester starts and while if we get it before having to actually pay it will be fine and the price will be reduced if it doesn't well let's just say for a very immigration friendly country"
karthiccc#0069,Every university is like that for foreign fees
J-Klar#4158,yes but its different when your community of countries literally votes on leaving an amazingly beneficial system just in order to tell muslims to go die
Lucаs#7263,My luck is insane
J-Klar#4158,Not really fun to see dark seal nerfs and fleet buffs
Lucаs#7263,i mean
Lucаs#7263,seal legit op
J-Klar#4158,They're just nerfing my build and buffing the strongest rune in the game
J-Klar#4158,Yeah it is to be honest
Lucаs#7263,hate to see those tahm nerfs
J-Klar#4158,I think they should reduce max stacks to 5 and give the item base mana
Lucаs#7263,he is no longer support just busted top lane and now they nerf him
J-Klar#4158,It used to give mana but no health
J-Klar#4158,Lee and ziggs nerfs tho
J-Klar#4158,That's pog
Lucаs#7263,shaco buffs
J-Klar#4158,Fair that champ sucks
Lucаs#7263,leave him like that
J-Klar#4158,Giga annoying during lane but then actually giga turbo useless later
J-Klar#4158,True
karthiccc#0069,Bro j4 buffs sickly
karthiccc#0069,If he gets good then he shall be the main
J-Klar#4158,you gotta play to have a main
karthiccc#0069,if I had time I would
J-Klar#4158,I fail to understand how you wouldn't have time. how many hours are you working lol
karthiccc#0069,8
karthiccc#0069,but i have other things to do when i get home
J-Klar#4158,what else do you
karthiccc#0069,well rn i have a shed that ive been forced to build
J-Klar#4158,wut
karthiccc#0069,yeah
karthiccc#0069,a shed
J-Klar#4158,well why are you building it lmao
karthiccc#0069,because my parents wanted shed
karthiccc#0069,"""so they said """"karthik"
karthiccc#0069,its not me entirely doing it like my dad works on it too but now its my turn to work on it
J-Klar#4158,i mean are you building it frmo scractch. wouldn't they be designed to be easily built
karthiccc#0069,well yeah its like the sheds from home depot
karthiccc#0069,but we just started
karthiccc#0069,so it gonna take some time
J-Klar#4158,yeah but surely thats the kinda thing you just knock out in one go
karthiccc#0069,not enough time to do it in one go
J-Klar#4158,I wouldn't have imagined it would be that difficult but i haven't built a shed in this life yet

karthiccc#0069,I mean cait r is around same time
J-Klar#4158,I dont think it is

Lucаs#7263,You can get the tip from me any time
Lucаs#7263,I’ve made this very clear I’m not sure why you’re confused
J-Klar#4158,sleeping soon eh
BlazeThief#4311,Lads I got some info today when getting wisdom teeth out
BlazeThief#4311,they measured me
BlazeThief#4311,and said I am 183
BlazeThief#4311,cm
BlazeThief#4311,tall
J-Klar#4158,why
J-Klar#4158,did they measure your height
J-Klar#4158,to remove your teeth
BlazeThief#4311,They said they needed to update their data stuff
BlazeThief#4311,So they measured height and weight
BlazeThief#4311,How many teeth did you get out when you got yours done jake?
J-Klar#4158,3
J-Klar#4158,had the other one out earlier
J-Klar#4158,cuz it was causing me to die
BlazeThief#4311,I got 4 but did they have like holes left in the back that weren't stitched
J-Klar#4158,probably but my mom said to not touch them ever cuz it aint good
BlazeThief#4311,I have like 2 that are just chilling there
J-Klar#4158,so i didnt
J-Klar#4158,"""they dont stitch them i think"
J-Klar#4158,did you get oxy?
J-Klar#4158,for pain?
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah they were like Imma give you some oxygen
BlazeThief#4311,and I was like chill im gonna breathe
BlazeThief#4311,and then I woke up
J-Klar#4158,no i mean after
J-Klar#4158,like pills
BlazeThief#4311,I got some stuff I been taking
BlazeThief#4311,think its mostly like advil and stuff though
BlazeThief#4311,not sure about oxy
BlazeThief#4311,Know apparently they gave me morphine but that was like during or right after
J-Klar#4158,good and bad. im not kidding that stuff is really addicting i had like 6 pills or something and i feel like if there had just been 2 more i would've become giga addicted
J-Klar#4158,it was relally good
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeeeeeeeeesh
BlazeThief#4311,Im just sitting here wanting to eat normal food
J-Klar#4158,just keep the gauze in there until it stops bleeding then just avoid opening your mouth lmao
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah it stopped bleeding pretty early on
BlazeThief#4311,And now im just kinda sitting here icing it
BlazeThief#4311,Wack getting all 4 thou
J-Klar#4158,did u get like mouthwash or something to clean it?
BlazeThief#4311,Not really I think
BlazeThief#4311,My mom just been telling me to rinse with salt water
J-Klar#4158,yeah its pretty much what i had
J-Klar#4158,"""except it didn't taste like salt water"
J-Klar#4158,which was nice
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeeeesh
J-Klar#4158,should i even bother watching this black widow movie
BlazeThief#4311,I didn't and probably will not
J-Klar#4158,1) who cares and 2) i've heard its just not that good
BlazeThief#4311,I was watching someone stream
BlazeThief#4311,it was shiphtur I think
BlazeThief#4311,and that saber guy asks if he should watch it
BlazeThief#4311,he just said
BlazeThief#4311,its funny
BlazeThief#4311,From what I've seen its not really good but its good for a little chuckle
J-Klar#4158,i think ill just watch new bad batch episode
BlazeThief#4311,That show gucci?
J-Klar#4158,does shiphtur just not play league anymore?
BlazeThief#4311,Not sure
BlazeThief#4311,Half the time he just watching master chef
J-Klar#4158,also idk its good i guess but i feel like its only good if you like star wars
J-Klar#4158,otherwise i don't think its worth your time
BlazeThief#4311,I'd have to rewatch to appreciate
BlazeThief#4311,And shiphtur has become the pokemon unite gamer
BlazeThief#4311,And valo gamer
J-Klar#4158,ah so bad
J-Klar#4158,got it
BlazeThief#4311,Pokemon unite kinda cool
BlazeThief#4311,But also weird
J-Klar#4158,nah merak more than just the films. like the games and other tv shows
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeeeeeesh
J-Klar#4158,giga geek about it
BlazeThief#4311,I think the stuff is decently cool
BlazeThief#4311,but I ain't like a giga fan
J-Klar#4158,honestly the legends stuff (non-cannon but everyone says it is cuz its better than shitsney) is much more interesting and cool
BlazeThief#4311,Aren't they trying to make those into canon stuff soon though?
J-Klar#4158,I'm not really sure. it used to be cannon so maybe
J-Klar#4158,I believe they're making a kotor tv show so a good portion of it will be if that happens
BlazeThief#4311,And they making that probably not canon thing with the star wars vision anime right?
J-Klar#4158,i still dont know what that is. haven't ever even heard about it or seen anything about it apart from you guys
J-Klar#4158,so i dont really get what that is
BlazeThief#4311,It looked like it was gonna be like that love death and robots show on netflix
J-Klar#4158,if its made by disney its cannon
J-Klar#4158,if it isn't it isn't
J-Klar#4158,thats how it works now
BlazeThief#4311,just a bunch of short stories
J-Klar#4158,that would be cool
BlazeThief#4311,and each episode is animated by a different studio/person
BlazeThief#4311,They look to be doing the same sorta thing with this since it showed a bunch of anime studios
J-Klar#4158,:(
BlazeThief#4311,Our day 2 update
BlazeThief#4311,everything on the bottom has swollen
J-Klar#4158,yeah the bottom ones are always worse
J-Klar#4158,i think because when removing top you have gravity assistance
J-Klar#4158,thats just a random guess tho
BlazeThief#4311,Wouldn't be suprised
BlazeThief#4311,but apparently when you get the top ones it messed with your nose and crum a bit
BlazeThief#4311,which makes sense since l legit can't breathe out my nose constantly
J-Klar#4158,well i didn't have that
J-Klar#4158,Riot Games lady and gents
karthiccc#0069,indie company
J-Klar#4158,just really struggling with a lack of resources
J-Klar#4158,They should ask for donations or something
J-Klar#4158,You know it doesn't really make any sense that Riot nerf champions in a way that effects what they're strong against. Shouldn't they only be nerfed against what they're designed to be weak against? (Tho tbh Im very glad they didn't make ranged matchups any worse)

BlazeThief#4311,you got the vaccine but guess what I evolved and can beat it now
BlazeThief#4311,Or are you still chill even with the first 2 doses
J-Klar#4158,no it has nothing to do with vaccinated people
J-Klar#4158,it just as a higher transmission rate
BlazeThief#4311,ohhhhhhh
BlazeThief#4311,So it just spreading faster than the og variant ?
J-Klar#4158,so those who are unvaccinated (ie little kids who are already gross and most likely not going to follow proper social distancing rules) get fucked harder

J-Klar#4158,idek there were on and offs tbh
J-Klar#4158,cant really tell the difference
J-Klar#4158,the lockdowns never really felt like the effected anything
Lucаs#7263,Yeah like I remember the first day of a lockdown it was a Saturday or something and I went into tims in the morning and there was legit a line of people going outside the building probably like 15+ people and not even close to 6ft apart

J-Klar#4158,so instead of using the 3 big lore events / world ending events they just made another one about a honry boi who just gets bonked
J-Klar#4158,k
J-Klar#4158,hold on a second
J-Klar#4158,"""I was about to explain the 3 of them"
J-Klar#4158,There is the mord one and the void one which are whatever big deals

karthiccc#0069,im confused and stupid
J-Klar#4158,ok well viego doesnt really have anything to do with morde or anything
J-Klar#4158,"""its just either rune wars / following ryzes journey to obtain and hide all the runes"

karthiccc#0069,they get rejected even by dead girls
karthiccc#0069,and is hated by everyone
karthiccc#0069,even inanimate objects that come to life

Lucаs#7263,They coat the raisins in sugar so I like them
J-Klar#4158,?
J-Klar#4158,no
Lucаs#7263,They literally advertise it as you having to add fruits becuase it’s that bad
J-Klar#4158,fruit in cereal is a sin
Lucаs#7263,Therefore all bran is a sin
J-Klar#4158,idek what bran is tbh
Lucаs#7263,I’ll pull up to your crib and give you some
J-Klar#4158,doors are locked now

J-Klar#4158,Close-ish to where my grandparents love
J-Klar#4158,Live
Lucаs#7263,Yikes
J-Klar#4158,This is cool tho
Lucаs#7263,This has also caused fans to get gta 6 trending lol
J-Klar#4158,Anything makes them do that
J-Klar#4158,It's legit trending every other month
J-Klar#4158,To be fair it has been 8 years...
Lucаs#7263,Shots wack
Lucаs#7263,Although feel like it could be a bit of a  flop depending on how they do it
J-Klar#4158,it says remaster not remake so i presume just graphics update /  new physics
Lucаs#7263,I was talkin bout gta6 I never really played those games but yeah I think just graphics and stuff
J-Klar#4158,i dont really see gta  6 being a flop
J-Klar#4158,Rockstar don't really seem to rush game development (LMAO) and you cant really name any bad r* games
J-Klar#4158,pog I actually got Ryze Whitebeard lmao
BlazeThief#4311,Dangggggggggggggg
BlazeThief#4311,Its the spooky day
BlazeThief#4311,Apparently they used league of graphs though and its not good at all for ranking players
Lucаs#7263,conch
Lucаs#7263,bruh i just had the worst sleep of my life
Lucаs#7263,got the second shot yesterday and literally went to bed at 11:30 and did not actually sleep untill like 1am and then also woke up at 4am and 7am
BlazeThief#4311,Yikes
BlazeThief#4311,Might want to hit up a nap sometime if you tired
Lucаs#7263,slept one more time till like 9:30
BlazeThief#4311,Though how you feeling now?
Lucаs#7263,wack
Lucаs#7263,not like im gonna sleep more
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah it's a bit rough
BlazeThief#4311,Just gotta chill today if you can
Lucаs#7263,nah we grinding
Lucаs#7263,the grind never stops
J-Klar#4158,he played one game and left
J-Klar#4158,weird grind
J-Klar#4158,if you ask me
BlazeThief#4311,Grinds different for everyone
J-Klar#4158,You know what they say about people who grind longer
BlazeThief#4311,Whhat do they say?
J-Klar#4158,They got a big ol cock
BlazeThief#4311,That why they have to grind it down on the belt sander
J-Klar#4158,Not sure how to respond to that
BlazeThief#4311,Clear sign that I have defeated you then
maximumeffort1#3058,admit defeat jake
J-Klar#4158,I resign
J-Klar#4158,In fear for my un-sanded penis
Lucаs#7263,Did y’all take Tylenol or Advil for the second dose ting
BlazeThief#4311,I think I took some tylenol after for headache and crum
BlazeThief#4311,But they should have given you a paper thing
BlazeThief#4311,Just check that and make sure it good to take
BlazeThief#4311,Cause I can't remember what I took
J-Klar#4158,I just took advil for headaches and my arm
J-Klar#4158,They said advil and tylenol should work
J-Klar#4158,but tylenol is just pleb advil from my experience
BlazeThief#4311,But if the pain and stuff isn't super bad might be better to take tylenol just for now
J-Klar#4158,i dont really get why its not advil isn't an over the counter drug lol
J-Klar#4158,They're basically the same thing
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah I don't know
BlazeThief#4311,Is advil legit just the same just more mg? in it or something
Lucаs#7263,Nah it uses a different ingredient I think
BlazeThief#4311,Ah
BlazeThief#4311,I did use it decently often for the wisdom teeth
BlazeThief#4311,Since it helps with swelling
J-Klar#4158,Advil is a type of ibruprofen (anti-inflammatory) so it also assists in that
J-Klar#4158,Other than that added benefit they do the exact same thing
BlazeThief#4311,But it works better you'd say?
J-Klar#4158,No they work very similar I'm guessing that Advil on average costs more and thats the only downside
BlazeThief#4311,What this mean then
J-Klar#4158,I personally have better experience with advil
Pizzanat#6176,i drank water
Pizzanat#6176,ez
BlazeThief#4311,Jasper is just built different
Pizzanat#6176,which vaccine did you get again?
Pizzanat#6176,because i know my mom had some headaches with moderna
BlazeThief#4311,He got the moderna one right? or whatever it called
BlazeThief#4311,I can't remember
J-Klar#4158,I don't remember
Pizzanat#6176,but not much else for my dad or my brother
BlazeThief#4311,He gotta say
Pizzanat#6176,and i had none pretty much for pfizer
Lucаs#7263,Got moderna
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah first dose was a bit wack and second I just had headaches with pfizer
Lucаs#7263,And this shit wack
Pizzanat#6176,my family is just so much cooler that we don't get anything major
Pizzanat#6176,hah
J-Klar#4158,"""My first dose my arm just hurt"
Lucаs#7263,It hurts to do almost anything so I’ve literally been in bed 90% of the time I’ve been awake
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeesh
Lucаs#7263,Headache that is
BlazeThief#4311,Might be the play to take some advil or something then
Pizzanat#6176,the people at the place did recommend to drink a lot of water for me
J-Klar#4158,If you just take advil Lucas it will fix that
Pizzanat#6176,so maybe that helps a bunch?
BlazeThief#4311,And yeah drink some water
BlazeThief#4311,Just start going crazy on the water
Lucаs#7263,I’ve been drinking decent amounts of water
J-Klar#4158,Eh I already drank lots of water and it doesn't really do much
Lucаs#7263,Altogoigh I should probably eat too
Lucаs#7263,Haven’t eaten since 9pm last night
J-Klar#4158,it messes with you
BlazeThief#4311,Yeah that would probably help
J-Klar#4158,I just stopped being hungry
BlazeThief#4311,I get headaches from not eating
Pizzanat#6176,gotta get them calories
J-Klar#4158,because of it
Pizzanat#6176,brain energy
J-Klar#4158,and if you dont eat how are you gonna poop
Lucаs#7263,I won’t
Lucаs#7263,I will never make poop again
J-Klar#4158,and you wouldn't want that then would you
J-Klar#4158,cuz if you don't poop how are you gonna look at your phone
Lucаs#7263,Pooping is for losers
BlazeThief#4311,Wait you people look at phone while pooping?
J-Klar#4158,and if you don't look at your phone how are you gonna see my messages
J-Klar#4158,and if you don't see my messages how am I gonna get a response
J-Klar#4158,and if I don't get a response how am I gonna smile
Lucаs#7263,Actually if I need to poop I just eat cheese or drink milk and the lactose intolerance in me just let’s it flow out like water
J-Klar#4158,and if I don't smile nobody gets to see me smile
J-Klar#4158,and if nobody gets to see me smile the world ends
J-Klar#4158,so moral of the story is eat so you poop
J-Klar#4158,Either that or just look at the door
BlazeThief#4311,I always found it wack
BlazeThief#4311,Mostly just cause my brother does it and takes like 40 minutes in there
BlazeThief#4311,I just go in and get out
J-Klar#4158,only do it while im pooping
J-Klar#4158,but sometimes it takes time to release everything
BlazeThief#4311,Sheeesh
Lucаs#7263,Pro tip: skip wiping to get out of there even faster
BlazeThief#4311,Nah
BlazeThief#4311,Wipe till theres blood
J-Klar#4158,You're really on a roll today huh
Lucаs#7263,I actually shit blood quite often
J-Klar#4158,My kids use this discord sir
BlazeThief#4311,Have you never bled after wiping too much
Lucаs#7263,No not wiping too much I’ve just pooped out blood
J-Klar#4158,I don't wipe
J-Klar#4158,Wouldn't know
Lucаs#7263,^
BlazeThief#4311,All this reminds me of that guy who would catch his poo before it hit the water
Lucаs#7263,Mans is a ninja
J-Klar#4158,What water
BlazeThief#4311,Thats how I feel playing league
J-Klar#4158,thats just from watching too
BlazeThief#4311,How did you even find this

BlazeThief#4311,I don't get how you are supposed to make more friends
J-Klar#4158,more?
BlazeThief#4311,I feel like I can barely keep you guys as friends
Lucаs#7263,i dont get how you supposed to make friends online
Lucаs#7263,never once had an online only friend
J-Klar#4158,"""i've had them"
Lucаs#7263,seige friends???
J-Klar#4158,except this time
J-Klar#4158,going since early 2019
BlazeThief#4311,Some could say I am your online friend
BlazeThief#4311,Since you never see me
J-Klar#4158,well tbf never see any of you ever again
J-Klar#4158,so
Lucаs#7263,but i mean i know you irl
J-Klar#4158,sucks to be you guys
BlazeThief#4311,Honestly
BlazeThief#4311,Even without you gone it sucks to be me
BlazeThief#4311,Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy
J-Klar#4158,a bit left field
Lucаs#7263,nah u good G
J-Klar#4158,kinda weird that everyone wishes they were someone else
J-Klar#4158,guess its just like boredom sometimes
J-Klar#4158,and being someone else looks more interesting cuz its different
BlazeThief#4311,Nah I don't think about being someone else
BlazeThief#4311,Chill being me
J-Klar#4158,.
BlazeThief#4311,Im worse than my own worst enemy
BlazeThief#4311,So I wish it on myself
BlazeThief#4311,But nah aspects be wack
BlazeThief#4311,but I wouldn't want to be other person
J-Klar#4158,good point wouldn't want to lose my amazing jokes

J-Klar#4158,Well there is a lot of debate
J-Klar#4158,But in general
J-Klar#4158,Improving goes a great length to improving
J-Klar#4158,Ah but @KARTHIK is discord nitro really worth paying for?
BlazeThief#4311,Is he actually paying for it?
J-Klar#4158,I can't see how not
J-Klar#4158,over 2 months
J-Klar#4158,and i thought the epic games thing was only for one
BlazeThief#4311,We need the answers from the lad himself

Lucаs#7263,early game supp strong after VERY weak

BlazeThief#4311,Thats wack
maximumeffort1#3058,It might be because the lack of outings you got

Pizzanat#6176,I think
karthiccc#0069,here's the thing right
karthiccc#0069,so like we have to reserve online to **guarantee** a spot but like if we want we could probably just walk in and if there are enough lanes just use that
J-Klar#4158,cant we just reserve then and then pay back
J-Klar#4158,(i presume one person would have to pay in this scenario)
J-Klar#4158,or do you even pay when reserving?
maximumeffort1#3058,I mean I’m sure we can walk in
maximumeffort1#3058,But if we wanna be sure we can reserve
Lucаs#7263,i mean how many lanes they got
Lucаs#7263,cuz if we walk in at like 2pm on a friday then idk if therell be space
Lucаs#7263,but if they got hella lanes we might be fine
Pizzanat#6176,why wouldn't we just want to reserve then?

Pizzanat#6176,D:
BlazeThief#4311,Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
BlazeThief#4311,I made one
BlazeThief#4311,Bit choppy though
BlazeThief#4311,What you can do since the tenor thing is weird if you just save the gif as an image and send it then you can favourite it
BlazeThief#4311,and just use it like that
Pizzanat#6176,ye but how save as gif
Pizzanat#6176,that y it problem for me

Pizzanat#6176,and windows only lets me trim videos to one second min
BlazeThief#4311,Its just him taking a picture with his eye
Pizzanat#6176,and he does not stay for one whole second
